So for example, <em>C:\\Downloads\\<\/em> becomes <em>C:\\Downloads*<\/em>, while <em>*.eml<\/em> remains unchanged.<\/p>\n<p><em>Wildcard stars<\/em> are used to specify patterns with variable, unknown parts. For example, <em>a.eml<\/em> matches only that one file, whereas <em>*.eml<\/em> matches <em>a.eml<\/em>, <em>test.eml<\/em>, <em>important message.eml<\/em> and so on. But note that neither form matches <em>a.txt<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>The first example setting specifies that any files (or folders) created in the folder <em>C:\\Downloads<\/em> (and in any folder below it) will not be sandboxed. Note that the final backslash character is important, because a star will be placed at the end of the string.<\/p>\n<p>The second example shows how wildcards can be used to exempt <em>*.eml<\/em> files from sandboxing, regardless of where they are created. <em>.eml<\/em> files are typically created by Outlook and Outlook Express, when a message is explicitly saved to disk.<\/p>\n<p>The third example setting specifies that the Favorites folder of the active user account should be exempted.

In this example, a ProgramNamePrefix is used, so the setting only applies to the Internet Explorer program, <em>iexplore.exe<\/em><\/p>\n<p>The fourth example combines the previous two examples, by showing a path containing a wildcard, applied only to a specific program.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Note:<\/strong> For security reasons, this setting does not apply when the program executable file resides within the sandbox.
