It contains the user's profile directory (which includes the My Documents folder and Desktop), removable storage devices, network shares, and all non-system hard drives such as additional external and internal disk drives.&quot; Think of &quot;user space&quot; as everything outside the <strong>system<\/strong> (where the core operating system and programs live), in other words, outside the <code>C:\\Windows<\/code>, <code>C:\\Program Files<\/code>, and <code>C:\\Program Files (x86)<\/code> folders!<\/p>\n<p>Internally, a privacy enhanced box is based on three defaults:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Allow read access to system resources:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>C:\\Windows<\/code><\/li>\n<li><code>C:\\Program Files<\/code><\/li>\n<li><code>C:\\Program Files (x86)<\/code><\/li>\n<li>Registry resources under HKLM (but not HKCU) are readable and can be sandboxed.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Note:<\/strong> The read access provides a good balance between privacy and convenience.

This hides all files and folders outside the sandbox, but allows new files and folders to be created in the sandbox (unless specifically allowed by an overriding rule).

Note that setting a path to normal is meaningful only when a parent path was first set to something else, as done in privacy mode.
