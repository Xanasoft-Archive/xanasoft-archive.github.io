After using the Sandboxie trace facility to isolate the needed resources, this setting is used to expose the resources for use by a sandboxed program.<\/p>\n<pre><code>OpenIpcPath=\\RPC Control\\IcaApi<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>The first example exposes a resource provided by the Terminal Services subsystem. It can let a sandboxed program talk to that subsystem and discover other Terminal Server sessions active in the computer.

The process name of the target process must match the name specified in the setting. When this setting is not specified, Sandboxie allows only read-access by a sandboxed process into a process outside the sandbox. This form of the <em>OpenIpcPath<\/em> setting does not support wildcards.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Note:<\/strong> The examples in this page, if applied, will create vulnerabilities within the sandbox.
