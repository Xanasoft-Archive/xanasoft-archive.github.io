The game may install its files to a folder on drive P, but any menu shortcuts it creates will be installed in the Windows Start menu of the local computer, outside drive P. And any registry keys it creates will also be created in the Windows registry, also outside the USB device.<\/p>\n<p>By contrast, if you set the <a href=\"SandboxMenu#set-container-folder\">container folder<\/a> to drive P (for instance <em>P:\\Sandbox<\/em>), then install the game into the (sandboxed) drive C, then <em>all<\/em> objects created by the installation will be redirected to drive P.<\/p>\n<p>You can then carry the USB drive to another computer where Sandboxie is installed, and set the container folder on that other computer to drive P.
