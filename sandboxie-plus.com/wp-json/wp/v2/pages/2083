Enable <strong>Trace Log<\/strong> tab by opening <strong>Options<\/strong> menu -&gt; <strong>Trace Logging<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>2. When the Trace Log tab is activated, it immediately starts to collect and display resource access information from all sandboxed programs that are running.<\/p>\n<p>3. At this point, perform any specific tasks that fail when done under the supervision of Sandboxie Plus.<\/p>\n<p>4. Finally, right click on the collected data and select the entry named <strong>Copy Panel<\/strong>. This copies the collected data into the clipboard.<\/p>\n<p>5. You can now paste (Ctrl+V) the collected data somewhere and make it available for analysis.<\/p>\n<p>6. Optionally, the keyboard shortcut CTRL+F can be used to search for specific entries within the Trace Log tab.<\/p>\n<h3>Performance Impact<\/h3>\n<p>When inactive, the Trace Log does not use any system resources and does not have any performance impact on any running programs. When active, the Trace Log has a small performance penalty on sandboxed programs.<\/p>\n<h3>Additional Improvements<\/h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Sandboxie Plus v0.7.0<\/strong> adds the ability to adjust the buffer size with <code>TraceBufferPages=2560<\/code>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Sandboxie Plus v0.8.0<\/strong> adds the ability to disable resource access monitor for selected sandboxes with <code>DisableResourceMonitor=y<\/code>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Sandboxie Plus v0.9.8b<\/strong> adds the ability to save the trace log output into a new .log file (via the floppy disk icon).<\/p>\n<p><strong>Sandboxie Plus v0.9.8d<\/strong> adds the ability to select multiple access types at once.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Sandboxie Plus v1.0.16<\/strong> adds a monitor mode to the resource access trace.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Sandboxie Plus v1.9.6<\/strong> adds a full stack trace to all trace messages. Note that activating the Trace Log also turns on the Keep Terminated feature. This is not a bug, but a new intended behaviour. Without it, the stack trace in the Trace Log would not work properly, as it uses the process objects to cache the symbols.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Sandboxie Plus v1.10.1<\/strong> adds an auto scroll functionality (enabled by default in the monitor mode).<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Trace logging (for Sandboxie Plus) The Trace Log tool displays the names of any system resources that are accessed by programs running under the supervision of Sandboxie Plus.
