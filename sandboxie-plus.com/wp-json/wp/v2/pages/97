See issue <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/sandboxie-plus\/Sandboxie\/issues\/19\">#19<\/a> to track any possible change about this.<\/p>\n<h3>Office 2013 on up &amp; Office 365 (C2R Versions only)<\/h3>\n<p>Problem: Click to Run versions of Microsoft Office 2013, 2016 and Office 365 will crash when sandboxed. This includes Outlook 2013 and up.<\/p>\n<p>Solution: A fix was included on <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/sandboxie-plus\/Sandboxie\/releases\/tag\/0.9.7\">v0.9.7 \/ 5.52.1<\/a>. It can be applied manually with most recent Sandboxie versions, see <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/sandboxie-plus\/Sandboxie\/issues\/428#issuecomment-932708577\">#428<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Tor Browser<\/h3>\n<p>Problem: Tor Browser is very slow in a sandbox, crashes or crashes after a certain time.<\/p>\n<p>Solution:  A fix was included on <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/sandboxie-plus\/Sandboxie\/releases\/tag\/1.0.21\">v1.0.21 \/ 5.55.21<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>HP Universal Print Driver<\/h3>\n<p>Problem: The HP Universal Printer Status Monitor pop-up component is failing when printing from a sandboxed Web browser.<\/p>\n<p>Solution: Open Sandbox Settings &gt; Resource Access &gt; COM Access, click Add and enter this resource name:<br \/>\n<code>{D713F357-7920-4B91-9EB6-49054709EC7A}<\/code><\/p>\n<h3>Autodelete feature on Microsoft Edge<\/h3>\n<p>Problem: Autodelete feature no longer works on Microsoft Edge.<\/p>\n<p>Solution: Microsoft Edge was updated with a new setting (under System) called &quot;Startup boost&quot;, which is enabled by default. It prevents Edge from fully shutting down, so we suggest to disable the option or install <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/sandboxie-plus\/Sandboxie\/releases\/tag\/v1.1.2\">v1.1.2 \/ 5.56.2<\/a> or newer versions which include the fix.<\/p>\n<h3>Steam games<\/h3>\n<p>Problem: Not all Steam games will function while Sandboxed.<\/p>\n<p>Solution: Install the games on your computer, not in a sandbox. Most games can work. However, there are <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/sandboxie-plus\/Sandboxie\/labels\/game%20issue\">known reports<\/a> that some simply may not. If you run into a problem with a Steam game, you should make sure Steam client is updated on your host machine. Run Steam not sandboxed, download and install the game on your host computer and then &quot;right click&quot; on the game shortcut and select &quot;Run Sandboxed&quot; as a workaround. If problems persist, please let us know the details by posting on the official Github repository <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/sandboxie-plus\/Sandboxie\/issues\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>GOG Games and Galaxy Beta<\/h3>\n<p>Problem: Games from GOG Galaxy may not run while sandboxed.<\/p>\n<p>Solution: No fix yet, see <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/sandboxie-plus\/Sandboxie\/issues\/1246\">#1246<\/a>.
