Normally, Sandboxie translates class names such as <em>IEFrame<\/em> to <em>Sandbox:DefaultBox::IEFrame<\/em> in order to better separate windows that belong to sandboxed programs from the rest of the windows in the system.<\/p>\n<p>However, in some cases, a program outside the sandbox might expect window class names to have a specific name, and therefore might not recognize the windows created by a sandboxed program. Specifying OpenWinClass=# resolves this problem, at the cost of a lesser degree of separation.<\/p>\n<p>Note that OpenWinClass=# does not allow communication with any windows outside the sandbox, and may interfere with some drag-and-drop operations.<\/p>\n<pre><code>   OpenWinClass=*<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>This setting tells Sandboxie to not translate window class names as described above, and also makes all windows in the system accessible to sandboxed programs, and goes a step further to disable a few other windowing-related Sandboxie functions. This may also cause the Sandboxie indicator [#] to not appear in window titles.<\/p>\n<p>Note that OpenWinClass=* allows full communication with all windows outside the sandbox, but may interfere with some drag-and-drop operations.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Identifying Window Class Names<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The unsandboxed windows are identified by their <em>window class name<\/em>, which is an internal name given to the window by the application that created it.
