										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Sandboxie Plus Business License, is specifically designed to empower your business operations in a commercial setting. With this license, you are granted access for one seat for a duration of 12 months.</p>
<p>Should your business require licenses for multiple seats, you&#8217;ll need to purchase a separate unit for each seat. Each of these seats will be provided with a unique serial number. By entering this serial number in the user interface, you&#8217;ll obtain a unique certificate that&#8217;s exclusively tied to your current motherboard&#8217;s GUID. It&#8217;s important to note that to use this certificate, you must be operating on Sbie+ version 1.10 or a newer version.</p>
<p>As with all good things, this license does have an expiration â€“ to enjoy uninterrupted access to the software, it&#8217;s essential to renew your certificate at the end of each year.</p>
<p>If your business has substantial needs and you&#8217;re considering a bulk purchase, don&#8217;t hesitate to get in touch with us. We&#8217;re more than happy to discuss potential volume discounts.</p>
