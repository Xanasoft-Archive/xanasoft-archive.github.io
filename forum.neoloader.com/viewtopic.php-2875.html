				<div class="content">1. i'd like to disable the feature that allows range links to get upload from me, i tried to deactivate everything in pref-hosters , i also tried restarting but nothing happend, they still have transfers. Ubuntu multifile test involved.<br><br>2. ok. here i have blank filenames [                             ] for some complete file, if you're not using ed2k network it's probably a ed2k only issue.  <br>EDIT: this is normal when NL is not interested in any file from that source. reverse.... if they don't have a file we need they don't show their filename. not a bug.<br><br>3. ok.<br><br>4. i noticed a bt client in my upload window that had 850 mb (consecutive - 1 upload session) recived and 100 mb given, that ahppened when i set my slot speed to 46 (this should be not related). i got some photo but they show nothing but what i'm saying. i asked david how to call this issue and i post it here in order to not forget it.</div>

				<div class="content">Regarding the 4th idk, I never noticed anything wrong, but due to TFT I think that you case could happen... not sure tought.<br><br>Regarding the 1st, I disable it and seems work correctly, but we could test it because maybe I had not any neo request (yeah, after all that time neoloader is not popular...)</div>

				<div class="content">+ reducing trickle slots from &gt;8 to 2 is resulting in a raise of requests (before [14/0] after a while "3h" [8/45]).  it could be related also to my choice to unshare 30% of my shared list.from 70 to 45 . <br>i'm actually not sure  if they are the real reasons for this raise, but i could see a big improvement.<br><br>p.s. NL uptime was about 24h when i decided to change trickles and share, i did not restart.</div>
