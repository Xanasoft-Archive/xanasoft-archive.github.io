				<div class="content">Random hash will generate a new userhash at every neoloader start (if I'm not going wrong), while static hash will generate one at first run and will never change.<br><br>With "Secure" we use the SUI system, this mean that our hash can't be cloned by other clients.</div>

				<div class="content">In random mode The hash will not be changed on each start only of the offline period was &gt; 6 hours.<br><br>Also the hash used in static secure (SUI) mode is not the same as used in normal static mode.<br>Meaning switching between normal static and secure static will not cause the client to be mistaken by others as a fake.<br><br>The feature was added due to not confirmed reports that a significant portion of releaser mods punish clients that don't have SUI.<br><br>Now this can be tested in the wild, if the portion really is significant, or if it is negligible and.<br><br>David X.</div>

				<div class="content">My opinion is yes, it should stay in the security window because is like any other security setting such as ipfilter and trackers.<br><br>Totally random hash helps to avoid tracking and static with sui is the reverse... is totally security related!<br><br>In fact, you did not added this because care about credits... and is clearly specificated that use the static SUI is not recommended because dangerous.</div>

				<div class="content">it's a good trade off.<br>However, i suggest the simple words <strong>Low</strong>, <strong>Medium</strong>, <strong>High </strong>instead of Minimized, Mediocre, Unrestricted. ;-)</div>
