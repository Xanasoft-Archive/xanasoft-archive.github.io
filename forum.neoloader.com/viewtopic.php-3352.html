				<div class="content"><blockquote class="uncited"><div>- With 2 multitorrent can happen that there is a file with same name/hash but in 2 different folder of the 2 different torrent. NeoLoader don't share it when see same filename or same hash (it happened with a .txt)<br>-- The duplicate file isn&#8217;t shared on ED2K or NeoShare but booth torretns should be fully shared on BitTorrent<br>In other words the duplicate status should not be propagated to the multi file torrent containing the duplicate.</div></blockquote><br>I explained better on skype, will update it if needed in next version bug list</div>
