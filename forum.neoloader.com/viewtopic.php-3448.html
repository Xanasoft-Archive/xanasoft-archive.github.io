I know that I requesting a lot but if not, it will not have much success.<br><br>Thank you!</div>

				<div class="content">I just moved your post here.<br>please create new threads for every new bug report.<br><br><blockquote class="uncited"><div><span style="color: #000000">It doesn't recognize torrents. </span></div></blockquote>What do you mean by that? You should be able to go into the grabber window and add torrents. Afterwards you right-click on them and chose "Download". Please explain your problem...<br><br><blockquote class="uncited"><div><span style="color: #000000">I wish that it would support links to FTP</span></div></blockquote>Theoretically if we treat FTP like a HTTP hoster page with a corresponding script we should be able to handle FTP links. Though this not really tested and ready for deployment. But we'll look into it, should be a nice feature.<br><br>Previewing movies is already partially implemented and we'll add it to one of our next versions.<br>Adding comments is a bit of a problem since every torrent client seems to have its own server to store comments? Or is there some unified torrent comment storage system? And our comment system should include comments to hoster links and emule as well, so I guess we'll have to wait until we hopefully have more users and then implement our own comment storage based on our Kademlia network.</div>
