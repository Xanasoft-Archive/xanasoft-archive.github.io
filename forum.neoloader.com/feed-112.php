On top/right of the search page you can set file extension... if you mean create a "Video" filter including all video extension, and "Audio" filter including all audio extensions I don't know, let's wait for D.X. answer.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forum.neoloader.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=2495">Neo26</a> — Sat Jan 03, 2015 4:56 pm</p><hr />

I mean, there's not any sense to download the chunks from first to last following this order, instead of the "normal" chunk selection (neo should use "zz" system). It's useful IMHO only when you want to stream a video file. If I am downloading an archive, or an ISO file, expecially if it's rare, why should I be allowed to bypass the normal chunk selection system that takes the less spread chunk first (if possible) ?<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div><br />which give preference to the first pieces? Or an option for this?<br /></div></blockquote><br />If you mean "get preview chunks first" its already avaible, und options-general-"download preview sections first". "Stream File" its a different feature that tries to get the first chunk to the last chunk in order to reproduce a video file while downloading. It's designed for popular video files, but if you don't want watch it while downloading it absolutly doesn't provide any benefits.<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div><br />"follow the majority", which is to rename the downloaded file to what is used by most peers?<br /></div></blockquote><br />Yeah but what's the benefit of doing that?

"Never"? It is not possible that just as eMule and Torrent, which give preference to the first pieces? Or an option for this? Building on the topic, you can not have some features, such as "follow the majority", which is to rename the downloaded file to what is used by most peers? The bar is horizontal with buttons instead of a vertical bar with text only? You also can not have those pre-defined filters to emulate the style (Video, File, Documents, Directories, Audio, etc.)? The option to show the countries of peers (disabled by default) with their respective flags, this is useful when'm downloading common content of my country. Of course, these requests are not for now, but who knows in the future.

Absolutly not, neoloader should never download the chunks in a "stream" order if the streaming of the file is not possible.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forum.neoloader.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=2495">Neo26</a> — Sat Jan 03, 2015 9:41 am</p><hr />

1.<br />Qbittorrent have the feature,but it can support all files and multifile.<br />EX:<br />If a lot of picture is in the multifile or archive file,streaming multifile or archive file is useful for user.<br /><br />2.<br />Neolaoder can't play some media files(.TS .RM .RMVB .....).<br />Neoloader shouldn't check final file extension for playing,because player has the feature.<br />If files can't be played,user will be noticed by player.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forum.neoloader.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1087">enOehTsIsihT</a> — Sat Jan 03, 2015 3:39 am</p><hr />
