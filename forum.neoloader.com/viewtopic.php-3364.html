				<div class="content">- Can't choose Temp folder in 1st start wizard<br>-- this is intended behavior (not a bug), we need to force the incoming directory and the temp directory to be on the same physical drive.<br>- In 1st start wizard advanced options are not show, after turning off only grey out. It should be grey out and not invisible even first<br>-- removing the items again would be better i agree, but it would be more complicated to implement, and I believe it does not really matter if its grayed out or fully hidden. I will leave it as it is for the foreseeable future.<br>- Default columm size & order have no sense<br>-- fixed in 0.31 using settings you send me<br>- Lag switching windows that show previous window<br>-- fixed in 0.31 when switching and waiting for new file list window is cleared.<br>- torrent download find peer but don't download<br>-- fixed in 0.31 issue was only with *,torrents not with magnets<br>- No fileicon with magnet links after grabbed. It works after restart &lt;--- tried more times and now no more happens, strange<br>-- fixed in 0.31<br>- AutoShare ed2k is active, but right click on single files it says not<br>-- fixed in 0.31, Note: after changing the setting it is not applyed to old files, also note that the state is being set only after the file was hashed and a ed2k has<br>- When removing/deleting a file from downloads, it is not canceled from Temp folder<br>-- fixed in 0.31<br>- When downloading multiple torrent files since the folder is not wrote on incoming folder there is a bug in filelist<br>-- fixed in 0.31<br>- single file sharing does not work<br>-- fixed in 0.31</div>
