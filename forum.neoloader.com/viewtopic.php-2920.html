<br>I have no plans in an upgrade for the short term, my P3 + XP are working just fine for many years now.
<br>(found it in a recycle container...)
<br>I agree that an atom board or other "micro" PC is for me a good upgrade option.
<br>They are powerfull and can handle all my PC needs.
<br>Other things I like, very small, passive cooling, low power consumption.
<br>So its no problem for me, in case you have some spare time and feel bored maybe you can fix that problem.
<br>In the meantime I have the tools I need for all my p2p needs.</div>

<br>When CPU load is minimal it will have not much impact, but on full load its a different story, I think.</div>

				<div class="content">If my P3 goes from min load to 100% temp of heatsink goes from body temp to barely touchable.
<br>
<br>On topic again.
<br>Had a look at compiling QT5 on a windows box, but it didn't make me happy.
<br>I think much easier to do on a Linux box which I currently don't have.
<br>No need to worry about dependicies thanks to great package managers.
<br>If it's only some compiled binaries you need ask the guys from Quazaa.
<br>They were very helpfull in the past and within hours they uploaded a new debug version.
<br>Then you could also ask the the devs. from SoulseekQT or qBittorrent.
<br>Maybe on the long run when I have more time I can set up a Linux box and try to compile Neo myself.
<br>As long as I do not have to edit the code.</div>
