				<div class="content">"Never"? It is not possible that just as eMule and Torrent, which give preference to the first pieces? Or an option for this? Building on the topic, you can not have some features, such as "follow the majority", which is to rename the downloaded file to what is used by most peers? The bar is horizontal with buttons instead of a vertical bar with text only? You also can not have those pre-defined filters to emulate the style (Video, File, Documents, Directories, Audio, etc.)? The option to show the countries of peers (disabled by default) with their respective flags, this is useful when'm downloading common content of my country. Of course, these requests are not for now, but who knows in the future. Hugs.</div>

				<div class="content">I mean, there's not any sense to download the chunks from first to last following this order, instead of the "normal" chunk selection (neo should use "zz" system). It's useful IMHO only when you want to stream a video file. If I am downloading an archive, or an ISO file, expecially if it's rare, why should I be allowed to bypass the normal chunk selection system that takes the less spread chunk first (if possible) ?<br><br><blockquote class="uncited"><div>which give preference to the first pieces? Or an option for this?</div></blockquote><br>If you mean "get preview chunks first" its already avaible, und options-general-"download preview sections first". "Stream File" its a different feature that tries to get the first chunk to the last chunk in order to reproduce a video file while downloading. It's designed for popular video files, but if you don't want watch it while downloading it absolutly doesn't provide any benefits.<br><br><blockquote class="uncited"><div>"follow the majority", which is to rename the downloaded file to what is used by most peers?</div></blockquote><br>Yeah but what's the benefit of doing that? Also, that's good for ed2k network only, torrent protocol doesn't have the renaming problem, plus the most spread file name sometimes is not the "original" file name. That can be discussed btw, let's see what D.X. thinks about that <img class="smilies" src="./images/smilies/smile.png" alt=":)" title=":)"><br>iirc this feature is avaible in MorphXT eMule Mod, but I don't remember who coded it or the first mod that implemented that.<br><br><blockquote class="uncited"><div>The bar is horizontal with buttons instead of a vertical bar with text only?</div></blockquote><br>I think that the UI can be (and should be) improved a lot, any suggestion for the future is accepted. But I don't know if a switchable bar could be made if that's what you mean.<br><br><blockquote class="uncited"><div>You also can not have those pre-defined filters to emulate the style (Video, File, Documents, Directories, Audio, etc.)?</div></blockquote><br>What do you mean? Can you make an example?<br><br><blockquote class="uncited"><div>The option to show the countries of peers (disabled by default) with their respective flags, this is useful when'm downloading common content of my country</div></blockquote><br>I already requested that feature some time ago, but keep in mind that if D.X. will add it, it will not be enabled by default because for most of the users is just a waste of cpu/memory usage. Let's see what he thinks here too, you have my +1 vote <img class="smilies" src="./images/smilies/smile.png" alt=":)" title=":)"></div>

				<div class="content">On top/right of the search page you can set file extension... if you mean create a "Video" filter including all video extension, and "Audio" filter including all audio extensions I don't know, let's wait for D.X. answer.</div>
