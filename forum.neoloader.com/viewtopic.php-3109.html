				<div class="content">ad 17.<br><br>hmm thats a problem, the start paused applyes only to the multifile that was added, the sub files are independent and set to started, as otherwise starting the multifile would leave the sub files paused.<br><br>I'm not sure how to solve this conflict properly, a sub file can be part of more than one multi file so i can not just replicate the multi file state onto its subfiles.<br><br>I will have to think about a proper solution it may be tricky :/<br><br>EDIT: I think i have a workable workaround, i will make the commands apply start/stop/pause commands to all files that are in the tree cherarchy below, this ay i can set all sub files on paused that are new and when the user resumes the multi file automatically resume the new sub files.<br>I will put that solution on my todo for the next major release.<br><br>EDIT2: no thats a bad idea :/ than one could not select what sub files to download, i will have to think some more on the usage concept.<br><br>David X.</div>

Is obvious, the 2nd attemp for delete the already completed files, that in the 90% case of multi torrrent are useless, is a wasting of time.<br>Regarding the #4 is obvious that if I remove a file, his empty folder in incoming should be deleted as well, and not that I have to do it manually.<br><br><blockquote class="uncited"><div>#05 Famous overhead problem<br>working on that low priority</div></blockquote><br>Change your priorities.<br><br><blockquote class="uncited"><div>#08 Ipfilter: We need a way to make bluetack list working...<br>I don't think so, if thay really require first a visit on their page its not worth the afford</div></blockquote><br>They don't require it, the problem is in neoloader.<br><br>---<br><br>I'll test the client again only when you did some changes on these points, and then I'll provide more information on ed2k side (stucked bug).</div>

				<div class="content">ad 17.<br><br>The fix is ready and it will work like this:<br>To select what subfiles to download the user will not have to use start stop on subfiles but the priorities setting that now was extended with a "Halted" priority that means don't download.<br>and the start/stop states will be replicated on all sub files in the tree hierarchy like in my initial idea.<br><br>I think this fix gives a good usability and flexibility.<br><br>David X.</div>
