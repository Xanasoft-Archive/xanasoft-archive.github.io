				<div class="content">"Play" is the trigger of stream file.
<br>There is  some reason for removing the trigger of stream file.
<br>If user click "play",neoloader enable stream file automatically.
<br>1.
<br>When neoloader enable stream file, it can reduce download speed.
<br>2.
<br>User only can preview the first few parts of file.
<br>
<br>I think "preview file" and "stream file"  have  some difference.
<br>Let user have the choice of stream file.</div>

				<div class="content">There is the other feature requests.<br>1.<br>If file's first and last piece doesn't be completed ,let play be disabled(gray).<br><br>2.<br>If file is in the  shared tab,let user can double click to open file.</div>

				<div class="content">I will remove the stream option as a switch entirely, instead I will use a request based trigger for chunk selection.<br>That means, if the user hits play a VLC player will open or whatever player was configured and instead of getting a local path to the temp file (what is a problem as currently in that case completion fails as it cant move the file) it will get a <a href="http://localhost:1600/" class="postlink">http://localhost:1600/</a>... url to play the file from neo's stream server, here Neo understands the range requests of the player and downloads this parts the player have requested, such that you can even seek through a just started movie file for example.<br>When the player quits the streaming status will be reset back to normal request behavior.<br><br><br>Sorry for not responding to this request for so long but this feature was in the pipeline for quite some time now and in will be finished in the next beta.<br><br>About the first last chunk option this will remain as it is now since we generally can not use streaming in ed2k as it is far to slow.<br><br>About graying out play, for torrents that's pointless you can usually start watching the torrent right away no need to wait for first last part. So I will need to look for a more complex indication for graying out the play button.<br><br><br>About opening files thats not so simple as you can connect a neo gui on one machine to a core on an other machine, <br>so i wil have to implement it such that if the two neos are on different devices double click wil not trigger an open but a http download of said file.</div>
