I can tell you stupid example that is: Download the file X from BitTorrent and from ed2k, tell me which is faster. But by the way I expalin you why it is faster:<br>- Torrent doesn't have the credit/queque system (and no, emule's system is not sophisticated at all lol)<br>- Torrent doesn't have the 3kb/s slot limit<br>- Torrent doesn't need to transfer 9 Mb before another peer can start uploading datas<br>- Using well know BT websites searching a torrent u have more information, know the release of new files and fakes are very rare<br><br>Why should I use .zip archives ? With multifile people can choose what they want download and what not.<br>Why should I use .emulecollection ? I don't want to share an additional file for share a discography for example.<br>Why people are so brainless? They aren't, they just don't want to wait days with PC on to download something while can be downloaded in some minutes with another software...<br><br>For the reasons above it is obviously diying.<br><br>Would you like to talk also about that most of the torrent clients work on any platform, even android while the only emule's alternative its aMule ?</div>

				<div class="content"><strong>Incoming Folder & Sorting</strong>
<br>
<br>Alphabetical sorting is still not working properly:
<br>1. Folders beginning by a number.
<br>2. Files beginning with numbers.
<br>3. The rest of folders.
<br>4. The rest of files.
<br>Of course folders should be first, files later.
<br>
<br><blockquote class="uncited"><div>I have 3 files (file1, file2, file3) in incoming folder and I have somewhere folders "music" and "books", NeoLoader will show: books, file1, file2, file3, music. I want it to show: books, incoming, music.<br>anyone to second that request?</div></blockquote>
<br>It's unintuitive. In eMule you can display "All files" one-by-one, or files in catalogs (folder tree); Shareaza for example displays files in catalogs. But your program displays catalogs, AND files from Incoming folder! Incoming folder should be treated as any other folder (and pinned to the top of list and expanded if no other folders exists), am I right?</div>
