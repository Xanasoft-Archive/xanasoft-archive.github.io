				<div class="content">&gt;25. Multi file have two hashes(neox).<br>Is not a bug, if the hash is red (banned) or yellow (possible) it does nto mean the file is currently associated with the file, bu that it is known to the Hash Inspector, as eider banned due to a hashing conflict or a possible hash to be used next if the currently used one (green/gray) gets banned<br><br>&gt;20. When network doesn't run,neoloader still get current IP(bitorrent).<br>is nto a bug, NeoLoader remembers the old IP it head during the rpeviuse session and displays those.</div>
