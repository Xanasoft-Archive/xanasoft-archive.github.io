<br>6.
<br>Neoloader crash when it downloads multifile from neoshare.
<br>
<br>Three transfers(neo1,neo2,neo3) download the same multifile from neoshare.
<br>Neo1 is the first  transfer. Neo2 is the second transfer. Neo3 is the third transfer.
<br>Neo3 has a high probability of crash.

In short... torrent client recognizion bug.</div></blockquote><br><br>Bad news, this bug is not fixed, screenshot proof: <a href="jMBb0Sp.jpg" class="postlink">http://i.imgur.com/jMBb0Sp.jpg</a> (some cifres are hide for privacy)<br><br>New UI bug regarding the download and shared windows:<br>- If I put to download only a single file from a multifile, the file added in download miss the folder icon<br>- If a file from multi is complete, it appear without folder icon in shared window<br>An example: <a href="4Tnt1wO.jpg" class="postlink">http://i.imgur.com/4Tnt1wO.jpg</a> - <a href="a1gs9pX.jpg" class="postlink">http://i.imgur.com/a1gs9pX.jpg</a><br><br>#####<br><br>Instead the bug of disappeared stopped file from a downloading multi torrent didn't happen. So I'll mark it as not always reproducable, but pls investigate on it soon to so I can delete it from list.<br><br>The offi bug list is been updated.<br><br>#####<br>Also, autoshare ed2k for multifile have a problem, it says that it's on but there is not an ed2k hash. When I moved out a file from subfolder and moved it to incoming, it shared the subfiles of multifile on ed2k (all of them!) and marked the only one as duplicate, so I removed it. And I can't determinate how much sources are from ed2k and how much bt, in fact I have one value on the subfile that is 0/43 and in the folder 0/~300. I bet 43 are ed2k but how much bt ?<br><br>Btw this way of handling is not correct, IMHO the not auto hashing is a bug, and if is intended instead I should be able to run the ed2k sharing manually, not see it ON and instead the only way to do it is described above. I will add this issue in the list.<br><br>#####<br>Some torrents are showed as no extension file and are unable to use when downloaded, I'll send you in pvt an example. Added in list.</div>
