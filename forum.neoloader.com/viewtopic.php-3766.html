				<div class="content">Make it happen David. We know you're the king of features <img class="smilies" src="./images/smilies/biggrin.png" alt=":D" title=":D"> (your Neomule mods are awesome!).<br>Besides, I'm sure most people would choose a multihoster (if they know about it) instead of several single hosters.<br><br>To start, integrate Zevera (download the API from the link above), test the plugin, make the UI newbie friendly, let Zevera know and they will give you the rewards <strong>&lt;&lt; Worth around 200-300GBP</strong>.<br><br><br>Request API from another multihosters (especially the one that support torrents ex. Real-Debrid, Alldebrid, Putdrive) and everybody benefit.<br>Pros: <br>1. For Multihosters: Obviously get more customers. And possibly save some bandwidth during peak hours.<br>2. For Torrents: Faster completed seeds, so it's easier for people to keep their ratio (on private tracker). And user most likely will keep the file shared; especially if they know it's on an anonymous network.<br>3. For ed2k: More completed chunks (lower ed2k queue <em>for other requested file</em> faster). And can help with current incomplete shares (if the hash matches).<br>4. For Neo: Jumpstarting the Neo Anon Network &lt;&lt; Very important. <br>5. For users: Faster download from multiple sources. Save resources, instead of opening several programs at once.<br>6. More popularity for your software and <em>attract more devs</em>, to help with bugs, features, etc.<br><br>.</div>
