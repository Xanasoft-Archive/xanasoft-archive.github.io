				<div class="content">When you download some files in eMule, you can right-click the donwloading file&gt;Context Menu-&gt;Select "Import parts to file..."-&gt;Choose the file's parts to import into uncompleted files.
<br>I don't find the similar feature in NL, maybe I missed it, if so, anybody could tell me how to import parts to file.</div>

				<div class="content">You cannot import parts iirc. But you can import downloads from eMule. <br><br>On top/left there's a button with a frog called "add torrent/container". Click on it, and choose the *.met file from eMule to import the download.</div>

				<div class="content"><blockquote class="uncited"><div> Why would you want it? </div></blockquote><br><br>Ask @continuer, I didn't request that feature. Is useful in some rare cases when you have missing parts of a rare download already completed with a mule. Or if you started the download from 0% because you forgot to import it from mule, you downloaded already something, and you can add missing parts from mule. Expecially for rare files. But IMHO that's a really rare situation when it comes useful.<br><br>No I didn't know this BitComet feature. If it allow us to get ed2k sources from a torrent while downloading, its really useful! If it does something else, I dunno :P</div>

				<div class="content"><blockquote class="uncited"><div>For torrents created with other torrent maker applications, as soon as the first BitComet peer from a swarm will finish downloading the torrent, it will calculate the eMule hashes for each file of the torrent and make them available to other BitComet peers who may be searching for eDonkey links for that torrent, through the DHT Network. From that point on, every BitComet peer of the swarm should be able to search the DHT Network and retrieve the ED2K links for that task and then search for those files into the eDonkey/Kad Networks, as well.</div></blockquote><br>thats exactly what NeoLoader does with its own NeoKad network.<br><br>Since Bitcoment is closed source, i don't think they will make their DHT extension public such that an other client will be able to querry their hash associations.<br><br>David X.</div>
