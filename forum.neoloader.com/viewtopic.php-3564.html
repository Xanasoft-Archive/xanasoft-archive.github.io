				<h3>A better UI/UX for NeoLoader</h3>

				<div class="content">well, I'm not a graphic designer by profession, but i think i can give some suggestions to improve the usability of the client.
<br>
<br>The option "GUI mode" is great, but i think we can do better by improving the icons and the interaction with the user. 
<br>
<br>I created a few mockups to give you an idea of how to change some aspects.
<br>
<br>The new main interface:
<br><div class="inline-attachment">
	
				<dl class="thumbnail">
			<dt><a href="./download/file.php?id=589&mode=view"><img src="./download/file.php?id=589&t=1" class="postimage" alt="iqh7uQUzk5FnS.png" title="iqh7uQUzk5FnS.png (45.63 KiB) Viewed 8271 times"></a></dt>
					</dl>
		

		
		


		
		
	</div>
<br>
<br>- <strong>Big icons, flat, simple, without chrome and shadows, where the icon mean or remind what the label says</strong>. 
<br>- Only one Progress Bar on top to report ongoing operations (hashing, search, starting in progress, closing in progress...)
<br>- Menu Bar useless. Many items can be placed inside More button. For closing NL there is X button on the right upper corner.
<br>- Status Bar useless. For display only important messages, a notification dialog (with autohide) will be better.
<br>- The <strong>views</strong> are organized on the tree on the left side.
<br>- The <strong>options</strong> are organized in the space at the top.
<br>- Grabbers / Searches / Player in the left are redundant, so you can make it unclickable. Only list of results will be clickable.
<br>
<br>A search bar "intelligent" and clearly visible. The research is the lung of a p2p client, so it must have more space. 
<br>When the user get the focus on the search bar, <strong>the view changes automatically</strong> for showing additional settings and the list of searches: 
<br><div class="inline-attachment">
	
				<dl class="thumbnail">
			<dt><a href="./download/file.php?id=589&mode=view"><img src="./download/file.php?id=589&t=1" class="postimage" alt="iqh7uQUzk5FnS.png" title="iqh7uQUzk5FnS.png (45.63 KiB) Viewed 8271 times"></a></dt>
					</dl>

<br>
<br><div class="inline-attachment">
	
				<dl class="thumbnail">
			<dt><a href="./download/file.php?id=589&mode=view"><img src="./download/file.php?id=589&t=1" class="postimage" alt="iqh7uQUzk5FnS.png" title="iqh7uQUzk5FnS.png (45.63 KiB) Viewed 8271 times"></a></dt>
					</dl>
		

		
		


		
		
	</div>
<br>
<br>
<br>It makes no sense to add an icon for each type of link  .... <strong>only one</strong> BIG ADD icon: D 
<br>The next window allows you to decide on the type of link to add (ed2k, collection, torrent, magnet, loaded from the HD, grabber). 
<br><div class="inline-attachment">

			<dt><a href="./download/file.php?id=589&mode=view"><img src="./download/file.php?id=589&t=1" class="postimage" alt="iqh7uQUzk5FnS.png" title="iqh7uQUzk5FnS.png (45.63 KiB) Viewed 8271 times"></a></dt>
					</dl>
		

		
		


		
		
	</div>
<br>
<br>MORE contains LESS (:-P) used options (and for this they are grouped), and needs to be "smart", show options only if required by the view. We will see "twitter" and "about", but we will not see "clean completed" if we are in the statistics, or Open WebUI if we are already in Browser  .... and so on.

				<div class="content">Why ? And all or only something? :-)<br><br>What do you think about present icons, that IMHO are too small and unreadable?<br><br>What is the correlation between an icon with clapperboard and "share" or "grabber" (NeoLoader is not a VideoPlayer!) ?<br><br>What do you think about search bar in the upper right corner that have same options (in the down arrow) that are already in the Search window? <br><br>Don't you think that a single window for pasting all kinds of link is better that 3 different windows? :-)</div>

Unfortunately, i've no this skill, so i can't help you more than this. :-(</div>

				<div class="content">We must not give up before trying.<br><br>I do not know, but i tried to do it by myself and provide a "modern" version, with some suggestions as a starting point.<br>No change in this direction?<br><br>A first step would be to try the <em>Usability Hallway Testing</em> over the current version.<br>Try to asking "add a collection and get file inside it", "download an http link from hosting", "do a search for a video file", "add a file in sharing", etc etc ... and record the random user behavior. These are the first feedback from which to start.<br>I am sure that with this version they will have a lot of problems to perform those actions. <br><br>If you deploy a public "mediocre" and not "usable" version, you will have lost forever the new users. The FIRST is the only installation that counts, not the version 0.80 or 2.0.<br>No matter how much code there is under the hood, but <strong>what the user sees the first time</strong>. ;-)</div>
