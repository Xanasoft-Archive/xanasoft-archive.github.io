				<div class="content">hi, <br><br>Hashing<br>NL is not completing files while hashing share dir. all files 100% ( theyaren't in incoming dir yet, "clear completed" does not work on them)<br>Can you add hashing priority? Temp (downloads in progress at 100%) &gt; shareset<br><br>Statistics<br>Is it possible to have some more entries in stats window? total shared files - amount of files pubblished in network 1 , 2 , 3 ...<br><br>Upload<br>blocking stalling or timed out requests are really annoying... can we prevent those clients to rejoin our upload if X upload sessions failed?<br>Upload Window - Column uploaded - can u let this column sort by amount uploaded in that upload session? now it shows as first the one who got most uploaded data in "general" NL session.<br>Slotfocus.<br>High-res timer.<br><br>thx, bye.</div>

				<div class="content">IMHO there are other priorities now... Slotfocus got removed because it was not stable... HighRes Timer waste more CPU/Memory...<br><br>Regarding the column and hashing request, its not clear.</div>

				<div class="content">hashing: after every nl upgrade i got to hash 5k file, this makes me wait 2-3 days before i can open the files i dowloaded cause they will be hashed at the end of the hashing process.<br>column: just visual thing, it is not important. it was just to have a more clear view on uploads.<br>statistics: Number of files pubblished via mulekad - via neokad - via torrent.. number of files that can be acessed via hoster upload.(files we are actually available for and the related network)</div>

				<div class="content">Shared window- columns: sources - upload<br><br>1.add 1 more column for networks icons istead of keep it tied to sources counter.or switch their positions   *Â°#  0|25/25 (0)<br><br>2.add 1 more column for [2/9] next to upload speed instead of keep it tied to upload.or switch their positions [9/2] 20 kb/s<br><br>so when sorting<br><br>1. you should be able to easily track files x netowrk/status you are sharing.<br><br>2. you can easily see "queue"/more requested files vs no/low requests files.</div>
