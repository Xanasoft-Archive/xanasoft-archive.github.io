				<div class="content">hi there,
<br>I have installed NeoLoader on OpenSuse 12.3 64 bits. I understand that NeoLoader is mostly a portable APP under linux environment, but is there a way to make NeoLoader open ed2k and torrent magnet URI?</div>

				<div class="content">There should be a checkbox in option general that do that, but I don't know if it works und linux. Wait for David's answer for more details <img class="smilies" src="./images/smilies/smile.png" alt=":)" title=":)"></div>

				<div class="content">No I'm sorry, this checkbox is only for windows,<br>I hadn't time to find out how to do that on other OSes.<br><br>Basically you need to call neo with the uri as sommandline parameter that would also work on linux, etc... but i dont know how to tell the OS to do that on file click, iirc. that would have to be done for each filemanager and each web browser individually.<br><br><br>PS: the current linux build is a bit outdated, i will try to upload a new one on weekend.</div>

				<div class="content">hmm... no it should be fine with ./NeoLoader "magnet:?....."<br>you could try with console, if it fails than its some bug in the IPC mechanism that I'd have to fix...</div>

				<div class="content">It works in command line. I am obviously doing something wrong with Firefox!<br>Also I don't seem to be connecting to Kad or Neo(kad?) network.  torrents work fine though! Maybe I should create a new topic, but how do I check if I am connected?</div>

				<div class="content">I found a few glitches here and there :b<br>Neo doesn't open UDP ports through UPnP, and when Neo is closed the ports open through UPnP are not removed from the router. Also I noticed that there is an entry for TCP 20035 NeoLoaderServer! Should this port be open? I thought this port was related with NeoCore and the localhost interface?!<br><br>The tray icon doesn't work, at least not in openSUSE 12.3 KDE environment.<br><br>MuleKad seems to do a bootstrap from the link <a href="http://www.nodes-dat.com/" class="postlink">nodes.dat - nodes server for emule kademlia net</a> Would it be better to bootstrap from known clients? This way the nodes will be in related with the files I am transferring?</div>
