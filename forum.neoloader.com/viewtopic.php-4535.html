				<div class="content">fixed autosort not sorting<br>fixed counter problem "Downloaded data counter bug" - for new counted stuff<br><br>about the torrent sub files comming back...<br>not sure how to solve it, actually you should nto be able to delete a sub file at all i think, as in case you want it back how do you do that?<br>I would sugest:<br>1. dissable deleting of sub files<br>2. pseudo delete them, say, delete data and set sub file to not download + show message about file not havong beed deleted due to<br>3. add a menu option to master files, restore missing subfiles... or somethign like this</div>

				<div class="content">Since actually there are other more important bugs, the 1st choice is better. <br>In fact, the start stop managment works ok, except the move from grabber to download windows cause problem and/or if the "added download in pause" is on, else is enough to manage them. Because in both case it will start all the files, also the one that you choosen as "stop" in the grabber or during the file was paused.<br><br>Maybe to fix when we do that move, it should remember the status in grabber and not autostart the main folder when added to download. For the other issue that is caused when downloaded files are in pause, I don't see any behavior of this feature, since we have the feature "always grab", so we could remove it.<br><br>Then it comes another little issue, when we want to start/stop the torrent without modify our decision regarding not download, well in that case a sort of "Force Stop" that ignores the operation done to main directory is helpful... and oh, it could work also from grabber!</div>
