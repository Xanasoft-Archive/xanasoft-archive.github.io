<br>
<br>HI,
<br>IIRC, there is a BT application for DD-WRT called TRANSMISSION. 
<br>I know little about DD-WRT developing. I asked for DD-WRT port because I thought the client part (run in background) and the UI part can be seperated for NeoLoader. If, by design, NeoLoader does not seperate client and UI (both rely on Qt), then it might be impossible for a DD-WRT port.
<br>
<br>Thanx for your effort.</div>

				<div class="content">HI,<br>IMHO, DD-WRT can be an opportunity for NeoLoader to gain more user base. There are plenty emule and bt client applications for Windows and Linux. Many current bt and emule users do not have the pressure or incentives to switch to NeoLoader. AFAIK, DD-WRT only have TRANSMISSION and Amule. It maybe a good chance.<br><br>Of course, developing and programming is never easy task. I just want to share my two cents opinion for you to consider.<br><br>Cheers.</div>

				<div class="content">We really appreciate your opinion and we consider it for sure, but I think it can't be done at the moment.<br><br>The reason is that there are many things to do (improve queque system, better UI etc.), many bugs to fix on windows (<a href="http://board.neoloader.com/bugs/3340-know-bugs-continuously-updated.html" class="postlink">http://board.neoloader.com/bugs/3340-know-bugs-continuously-updated.html</a>), the linux ver that crash on startup on my distro and I don't know other linux testers, and no testers for MAC as well (me neither). Once those problems are gone, it will be a chance, so why not.<br><br>In that scenario, the free time of developer is very limited, that's why I think that we should support this platform (yet <img class="smilies" src="./images/smilies/wink.png" alt=";)" title=";)"> )<br><br>Sorry for my bad english, and thank you for your suggestion. <br>Please give us a feedback if you tried the client in win/linux/mac and tell us if you encountered any bug that is not in list or if you have any suggestion <img class="smilies" src="./images/smilies/smile.png" alt=":)" title=":)"></div>
