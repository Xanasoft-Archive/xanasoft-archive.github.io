				<div class="content">The next release 0.42a will contain a lot of bug fixes and a fully reworked hashing policy, but this will take some more days, don't think there was no progress in the last weeks its just a lot of to change and cant be released partially.<br>A 0.42a will be available this year at least as beta download.<br><br>The new hashing scheme should not only resolve all the current hashing bugs, but also add new abilities, <br>like the possibility to assotiate more than one torrent into hash with a file allowing to download one and the same file from multiple singlefile torrents.<br><br>Happy holidays<br>David X.</div>

				<div class="content">"better" in general, with filename not short as progressbar for example, so each columm contain his value with a logic not random columm sizes.<br>I think is boring for the new user if he probably need to change the size of each columm manually. <br><br>Did you said that is reproducable only on 14'' monitor ? Didn't knew. I'm sure it will be fixed, anyway don't be angry for that, is just an UI glitch on a monitor size that is not pupular since 10 years. Until yesterday it was crashing on every complete torrent, I think that this was more important...</div>

				<div class="content">Is my personal experience, I don't know how those sites make their stats and how accurated are them. <br><br>I think their totally uselss, each website have different values, for example the browser statistic posted here are totally different <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/browsers/browsers_stats.asp" class="postlink">Browser Statistics</a><br><br>The last 14'' monitor with xp that I used was surely more than 10 years ago. Then the smallest monitor that I seen was mine 17'', the most spread instead was 19''.</div>
