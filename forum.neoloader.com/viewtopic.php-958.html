				<div class="content">Hi<br><br>I was running 0.50a and have a bunch of part completed downloads in a temp directory.<br><br>I saw there is now a 0.50f so I downloaded and installed this - however while I can scan for files and it will find my completed downloads and start uploading them, it did not do the same with the part downloaded files that I want to finish downloading.  Is there an option to get the software to recognise and continue them?  <br><br>Great software, many thanks<br>tart</div>

				<div class="content">Thanks, it turned out the previous install was in another directory, installing there only brought in partial downloads beginning with the letter F, G  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz"><br>Anyway I copied the old install files to the program directory to keep the upload history and started again.<br><br>By the way, in the Add Torrent/Container button, the first option 'All supported Files' does not include the 4th item in the list, the .met files, I guess it should include these.<br><br>Cheers<br>tart</div>

				<div class="content">.met files not being shown by default is intentional, as this are incomplete eMule downloads for import, while the other are download container files, like eMuleConnection or torrent or a DLC</div>
