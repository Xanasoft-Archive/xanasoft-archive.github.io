				<div class="content">Hi,<br>Yes thats somewhat possible but ... <br>iirc. you get the other IP by logging in to some service vpn or PPPoE or so...<br>To what extent windows would allow you having multiple parallel vpn connections open idk. that would have to be tested.<br>So it may be that you would still need a VM with a proxy application that the NeoLoader on the host would connect to.<br><br>Anyways this would be not very trivial to add as than Neo would need to manage internal multiple IP's/identity's ofcause doable but not as strait forwards as it could be.<br><br>What would be the benefit of such a feature?</div>

				<div class="content">Ok,<br>I will need to think about how to do that the best way.<br><br>Neo's internal layout would allow to have multiple client objects internally for each one source object, but since a VM is needed anyways for the login,<br>it may be more convenient to go again with a voodoo approach.<br><br>Multiple client objects would be the most elegant solution but also the most complicated one, and it would add some CPU/RAM overhead for use also without this feature.<br><br>The voodoo approach needs multiple full Neos to run but is simpler to implement as I only need to redirect the IO operations and duplicate the file list.</div>
