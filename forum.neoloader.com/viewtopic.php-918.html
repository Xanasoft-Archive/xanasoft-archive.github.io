				<div class="content">Ok... the installation went fine but 2 seconds after the configuration wizard NeoLoader had a crash.
<br>
<br>dmesg report:
<br><div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><code>&#91; 2229.087291&#93; QXcbEventReader&#91;1700&#93;: segfault at 7fb5089e3fc9 ip 00007fb5089e3fc9 sp 00007fb507bdeea0 error 14 in libXdmcp.so.6.0.0&#91;7fb508cc3000+5000&#93;</code></div><br><br>uname -a:<br><div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><code>Linux server 3.16.0-4-amd64 #1 SMP Debian 3.16.7-ckt2-1 (2014-12-08) x86_64 GNU/Linux</code></div>
<br>
<br>anyway I started NeoLoader with the -daemon option and it is working!

<br>
<br>Now I'll leave NeoLoader running to see if crashes
<br>
<br>David I have a dumb question: I wasn't able to pause or stop the download... only to "kill" it.. Is still the red wine in me?
<br>(Personally I hate the Android/ios style of the webserver... but I'm an @sshole! ;-))</div>

<br>Yes I use 64bit
<br>From webGUI I can connect without problem but no from Neoloader GUI, in connection manager I put server ip (remote host), 20035 (remote port) and * (password), but when click on connect nothing happens.

<br>I checked in ini file and port and password is good!

<br>Ps. the permission 777 was just a test then I put everything back as the original

<br>I strated by -core and by -daemon no crash problem
