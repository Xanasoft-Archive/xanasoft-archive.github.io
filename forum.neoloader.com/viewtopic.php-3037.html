				<div class="content">NeoLoader is a project done in my free time, and my free time is unfortunately limited.<br>We don't have any stuff on payroll that could be tasked with testing each release on a myriad of various platforms,<br>thats the job of our volunteer beta testers.<br><br>So you can not expect a bug to be fixed that haven't been previously reported.<br>Also due to time constraints bugs and changes have to be prioritized and GUI bugs obviously score rather low. <br><br>We could start a kick-starter campaign for a new NeoLaoder GUI that would be tasked to payed stuff from the campaign founds.<br>Although I think we need a little bit more reputation for that to be successful.<br><br>David X.</div>
