				<div class="content">Hi, first I want to thank Mr. Xanatos for another great product. I was a fan/user of NeoMule for a long time. I don't know why it took so long for me to find NeoLoader, but glad I did.<br><br>Now the question: Do I need to do anything else to get traffic flowing through the other networks&gt; I have been using NeoLoader for about 2 days now and it works fine, but only through the ed2k network. In the &quot;Statistics&quot; window I can see it says: <br>Bandwidth<br>	Upload Rate: 17.33kB/s (21.19kB/s) [3/3]<br>	Download Rate: 36.17kB/s (39.75kB/s) [5/6]<br>	Upload Volume: 386.39MB / 707.99MB<br>	Download Volume: 111.01MB / 252.33MB<br>	Active Connections: 8 (0)<br>	New Connections: 0<br>	Pinger<br>		Host: 199.229.229.153 (3)<br>		Ping: 386ms / 309ms<br>	PeerWatch: 31 - 15 - 0<br>File Stats<br>	Total Files: 183 (51.80GB)<br>	Paused Files: 0 (0B)<br>	Complete Files: 181 (50.90GB)<br>	Files with an Error: 0<br>Networks<br>	Neo Share<br>		Upload Rate: 0B/s (0B/s)<br>		Download Rate: 0B/s (0B/s)<br>		Upload Volume: 0B / 0B<br>		Download Volume: 0B / 0B<br>		Kad Status: Connected<br>		NeoShare Port: 41520<br>		Current IP: 184.75.214.163<br>		Active Sessions: 0<br>		Firewalled: No<br>		Routes<br>			e58e1c8abe9b95bd@7AE9094A26101B86ED56C7F4518D8FD5<br>	BitTorrent<br>		Upload Rate: 0B/s (0B/s)<br>		Download Rate: 0B/s (0B/s)<br>		Upload Volume: 0B / 0B<br>		Download Volume: 0B / 0B<br>		Torrent Port: 16284<br>		Current IP: 184.75.214.163<br>		Active Connections: 0<br>		Firewalled: No<br>		DHT Stats<br>			Nodes: 174<br>			Global Nodes: 25165824<br>			Lookups: 1<br>	ed2k/eMule<br>		Upload Rate: 17.33kB/s (17.53kB/s)<br>		Download Rate: 36.17kB/s (36.29kB/s)<br>		Upload Volume: 386.39MB / 707.99MB<br>		Download Volume: 111.01MB / 252.33MB<br>		TCP Port: 64702<br>		UDP Port: 64702<br>		Current IP: 184.75.214.163<br>		Active Connections: 8<br>		Firewalled: No<br>		Kad Status: Connected<br>		Kad Port: 64702<br>		Kad Stats<br>			Total Users: 214990<br>			Total Files: 40633110<br>			Indexed Sources: 1447<br>			Indexed Keywords: 1704<br>			Indexed Ratings: 1<br>			Index Load: 35<br>Hosters<br>	Upload Rate: 0B/s<br>	Download Rate: 0B/s<br>	Upload Volume: 0B / 0B<br>	Download Volume: 0B / 0B<br>	Active Uploads: 0<br>	Active Downloads: 0<br>IO Stats<br>	Pending Read: 0B<br>	Pending Write: 0B<br>	Hashing Queue: 0/0<br>	Allocation Queue: 0 (0B)<br><br>From what I can tell, all networks are connected and none fire-walled.

				<div class="content">NeoShare: Basically no users (hopefully yet).<br>Torrent: You need to add a torrent.<br><br>The multi-network does not work automatically in most of cases because most of the files are not indexed in neokad (lack of users...). <br><br>Actually you should add a torrent and add the ed2k hash manually if you want to download from both networks, for the sharing indeed just complete the torrent download and then activate the ed2k sharing, neo will hash the file and share on both networks.</div>

				<div class="content">Does that mean that only newly DL files that I DL using the Torrent network can be shared on both ed2k and Torrent, but all of the files I have already DL using eMule in the past, are not sharable on the Torrent network?</div>

				<div class="content">Torrent is not like ed2k or neoshare or other a file does not have a unique hash, the torrent info hash is made up of the part hashes + some additional data including the filename. <br>So to share anything on torrent you need to create a torrent manually.<br><br>Or do you want to add a info hash of an already existing torrent like you may found on kickass or tpb?</div>

				<div class="content">I have never used Torrent before. I have been using the ed2k/eMule/KAD network for many years. So I have a couple of TB of files on various drives I have saved, I rotate drives sharing. Can I share them on the Torrent network?</div>

				<div class="content">torrent is meant to share few files at once, plus if u create torrents of your shared files u'll be the only source, and (i'm kinda new to torrent too) i guess u need to link the torrent u created in some torrent related website in order to have requests from non neoloader users.<br>u can easily download new files with cross protocol, and this is the only way to appear among the sources for the most available torrent for that file (since creating your own torrent means u won't be part of that), u could even decide to not share files u got from crossprotocol, disabling both ed2k and torrent sharing, letting the file indexed on neokad only, that in practice (i'm pretty sure) will mantain ed2k/torrent assosiation for next neoloaders that will look for that file. this will help you to focus your upload on files that really need it.<br><br>long story short... you can create your own torrents for files there is no torrent yet, but transfering TBs of data  on your own it's a bit hard.<br>you cannot be part of the sources of an existing torrent for the old files you had from ed2k, and you can't neither appear as source among them with neoloader if you forget to add  btih:hash before you complete the download of that file (before the file be indexed in neokad).<br><br>one more thing... some torrents are folders, so the only way to download them from crossprotocol is to add the torrent to downloads first, open that folder in download window and add each ed2k hash to files contained in that folder, with folders this mechanism cant be reversed. with single file torrents the sequence is not a problem.</div>
