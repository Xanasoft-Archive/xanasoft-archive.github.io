<strong>Incoming Folder & Sorting</strong><br /><br />Alphabetical sorting is still not working properly:<br />1. Folders beginning by a number.<br />2. Files beginning with numbers.<br />3. The rest of folders.<br />4. The rest of files.<br />Of course folders should be first, files later.<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div><br />I have 3 files (file1, file2, file3) in incoming folder and I have somewhere folders "music" and "books", NeoLoader will show: books, file1, file2, file3, music. I want it to show: books, incoming, music.<br />anyone to second that request?<br /></div></blockquote><br />It's unintuitive. In eMule you can display "All files" one-by-one, or files in catalogs (folder tree); Shareaza for example displays files in catalogs. But your program displays catalogs, AND files from Incoming folder! Incoming folder should be treated as any other folder (and pinned to the top of list and expanded if no other folders exists), am I right?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forum.neoloader.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3790">Zebra</a> — Tue Feb 17, 2015 9:10 pm</p><hr />

I can tell you stupid example that is: Download the file X from BitTorrent and from ed2k, tell me which is faster. But by the way I expalin you why it is faster:<br />- Torrent doesn't have the credit/queque system (and no, emule's system is not sophisticated at all lol)<br />- Torrent doesn't have the 3kb/s slot limit<br />- Torrent doesn't need to transfer 9 Mb before another peer can start uploading datas<br />- Using well know BT websites searching a torrent u have more information, know the release of new files and fakes are very rare<br /><br />Why should I use .zip archives ? With multifile people can choose what they want download and what not.<br />Why should I use .emulecollection ? I don't want to share an additional file for share a discography for example.<br />Why people are so brainless? They aren't, they just don't want to wait days with PC on to download something while can be downloaded in some minutes with another software...<br /><br />For the reasons above it is obviously diying.<br /><br />Would you like to talk also about that most of the torrent clients work on any platform, even android while the only emule's alternative its aMule ?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forum.neoloader.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=2495">Neo26</a> — Thu Nov 13, 2014 11:48 am</p><hr />

An option that will never ever be added to eMule.<br /></div></blockquote><br /><br />IMHO custom server is useless by the way, a server owner told me that servers can talk each other so everyone stores the same informations... also there are not other client that use/provide per-file servers.<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div><br />Why 2 identical files with different names are recognized in BitTorrent network as 2 different (another btih) files? Why you cannot create identical .torrent (same btih) with different programs? Can you share a file by drag-and-dropping it into shared folder? Forget about DHT/Kad, how long BT trackers and ED2K servers live? Maybe a year, maybe two. Will be the tracker list inside .torrent file up-to-dated and usable after a year? No! The serverlist in your eDonkey client will always work! BitTorrent network is the only network without a possibility to search a file by a name!<br /></div></blockquote><br /><br />Identical .torrents doesn't matter because it happen only for very popular files so its irrelevant, from any source it will be downloaded so fast. By the way it happen because as far I know make identical torrent is not possible... but who cares?<br />Why should I share by drag-drop ? Creating a torrent takes just a bit of more time but I can make more, such as multifiles, can you make multifiles on ed2k ?<br />Regarding the servers, we're saying that will die in 1-2 year (I said that too) since 2008, but they're still alive. Anyway, doesn't matter because any torrent can work with DHT only now. Regarding the information that they contain your wrong, ed2k servers store more informations, since once connected they know all your shared files and index them, that doesn't happen with trackers, they just know the single torrent file.<br />Search file by name is actually not necessary when there are awesome websites that gives you much more infos on the .torrent compared with the emule search...<br />Also, eMule's (90% of ed2k clients) chunk sizes and slotspeed make the transfers very very slow, any BT client doesn't have that problem. (yeah, no subchunk transfer too, neo should have that btw I think the size is too big even here...)<br /><br />@esher: actually emule got the 90% of ed2k network, so if we want support ed2k network we must care a bit about them.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forum.neoloader.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=2495">Neo26</a> — Mon Nov 10, 2014 9:52 am</p><hr />

Forget about DHT/Kad, how long BT trackers and ED2K servers live? Maybe a year, maybe two. Will be the tracker list inside .torrent file up-to-dated and usable after a year? No! The serverlist in your eDonkey client will always work! BitTorrent network is the only network without a possibility to search a file by a name!<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forum.neoloader.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3790">Zebra</a> — Sun Nov 09, 2014 11:04 pm</p><hr />

I don't like neolinks too :P<br /><br />Regarding the porns problem in top files a filter to exclude files that contains certain words in the name could be added.

I'm sorry for not responding for a long time...<br /><br /><strong>Link system</strong>:<br />I think there should be an option to create a magnet links for eDonkey/Kad/NeoShare network:<br /><div class="codebox"><p>Code: </p><code>magnet:?xt=urn:neo:&lt;NEO&gt;&xt=urn:ed2k:&lt;ED2K&gt;&urn:aich:&lt;AICH&gt;&dn=&lt;NAME&gt;&xl=&lt;SIZE&gt;</code></div>in addition the program should recognize (but create correct "urn:ed2k:") partially incorrect links with "urn:ed2khash:" (Shareaza creates that). If a file contain an unsupported hash (bitprint) AND supported one the client should not display any errors and just add a file into downloads.<br /><span style="font-size: 75%; line-height: normal">I personally don't like "neolink" idea, Shareaza creators added a similar 3rd-party link shortener, for me it's useless... Maybe it's usable with hosters...</span><br /><br /><strong>Top files</strong>:<br />Is it completely decentralized feature, do you have control over it? What if someone will start uploading pr0n <img class="smilies" src="http://forum.neoloader.com/images/smilies/36_1_30.gif" alt=":36_1_30:" title="36 1 30" /> into hosters?<br /><br /><strong>Sick nomenclature</strong>:<br />In the interface I can find "Trackers", please don't use screwed BitTorrent nomenclature! Tracker is something what tracks and spies an user, in eDonkey network we have <span style="text-decoration: underline">Servers</span>, not trackers! Server means something which mediate/exchange peers. Transfers: it says connection encrypted, not encrypted but <span style="text-decoration: underline">obfuscated</span>!<br /><br /><strong>Incoming folder & sorting</strong>:<br />Incoming folder should be displayed as a folder similar as it's in eMule, now the program shows all files one-by-one in Shared tab. Now the Shared tab is a complete mess. It would be nice to sort a files in alphabetical order (AaBbCc...XxYxZz), not in Linux-alphabet order (ABC...XYZabc...xyz).<br /><br /><strong>History</strong>:<br />Why NeoLoader saves history of searched files in "GrabberList.xml" and "SearchLists.xml" files? There should be an option to disable that. There also should be an option in Archive tab to clean history with one click.<br /><br /><strong>Upload limit per network</strong>:<br />I've found an option in NeoCore.ini =&gt; BitTorrent =&gt; Upload, does it limit upload bandwidth in kB/s? If yes, maybe it should be set to 10kB/s by default to discourage using the worst and the most screwed P2P network ever created?<br /><br /><strong>Interface</strong>:<br />Grabber tab does nothing useful, it could be removed - you can paste links directly into downloads. Shared files - what does it mean started, paused, stopped; for me the file could be shared (file in shared folder), or unshared (file in shared folder, but excluded from shares), unshared files should be grayed out; there's no really need for dividing files into 2(3) categories. Similar with downloads...<br /><br /><strong>Searching</strong><br />Does "Smart Search" does actually do anything, or it's shitty option similar to "Automatic Search" in eMule? EDonkey servers, Kad, NeoKad, webpages provide different search results - for example Kad provides lots of results and spam, (trusted) servers provide less results but usually without spam, webpages provide no spam, but even less files.
