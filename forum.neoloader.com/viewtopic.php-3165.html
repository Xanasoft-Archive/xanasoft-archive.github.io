				<div class="content">Hi, I tried to turn that feature on/off but I see no difference, it's bugged?
<br>
<br>btw, there is still a lot of overhead not counted.</div>

				<div class="content">Control IP Overhead is a setting that shouldn't be public i think,<br><br>it also does not do what you think it does.<br><br>What it does is when disabled the bandwidth control always allows for IP overhead so that if you set your upload limit below the value that you generate in terms of IP overhead due to fast downloading, the overhead will go beyond the limit line int he starts. Say it wont be controlled or one could also say limited.<br><br>Howe ever any other upload traffic will remain limited, and the IP overhead will still be taken into account, say for example if you limit your upload to 20 kb/s and neo estimates 15 kb/s IP overhead it will adjust upload to 5 and the limit will be kept.<br><br>The limit will only be exceeded when the IP overhead is greater than the total set bandwidth limit.<br><br>I will remove the setting from the gui in the next version, though I'm not sure if to set it enabled or disabled by default.<br><br><br><br>About some overhead still not counted, it is some more IP overhead, it can not be counted by principle, it can only be guessed.<br>I don't know at this point how to make the guessing more accurate, I should add a MSS setting that would probably help.<br><br><br>David X.</div>

				<div class="content">Let's make this test in the beta and later we'll decide if keep that settings fur final version but I think once found an acceptable value the setting is not needed.</div>
