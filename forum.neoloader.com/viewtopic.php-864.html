				<div class="content">Hello, the tracker Pleasuredome doeswn't work with neoloader.
<br>The download doesn't start at all and the tracker details show  "Error: network error"
<br>Maybe some sort of banning</div>

				<div class="content">Is a sort of private tracker ? As far I know they have a lot of allowed clients, surely NeoLoader is not popular so is not allowed. <br><br>And not sure if those kind of trackers need a particolare compatibility (and additional) code and if yes, I bet is not avaible (yet) in neoloader.</div>

				<div class="content">Well, officially they have banned bitcomet as client, but utorrent,bittorrent and tixati are working.<br>Maybe neoloader is "unrecognized" and automatically banned</div>

				<div class="content">I've tried to request on PleasureDome forum the reason why neoloader is not allowed to download torrents from their tracker and the response is that: Anonymous connections are not allowed<br>But my question is: Are neoloader using a crypted connection under torrent module like utorrent, tixati and the others client, or it's a custom crypt?<br>Really I don't understand why their hare stating that neoloader it's an anonymizer...<br><br>The discussion is here<a href="http://forum.pleasuredome.org.uk/index.php?showtopic=23474" class="postlink">http://forum.pleasuredome.org.uk/index.php?showtopic=23474</a> <br>obviously they have closed my discussion as fast as Road Runner....</div>

				<div class="content">wtf?!<br><br>also neoshare is a separate network enabling / disabling it does not have an effect on torrenting.<br><br>Neos torrenting is designed to be a normal standard conform behavior, if there are issues I'd be heppy to fix them, thay just have to say me whats wrong.<br><br>The only way to get anonymus torrentign is to use a VPN or an other generic network traffic anonymizer.<br><br><br>What neo can do is it can download a file only by its torrent hash anonymusly form NeoShare or hosters if it is there available.<br>But thats strictly speaking not realated to actual torrenting.<br><br>Can you organize me some forum access for this tracker so I can ask them whats wrong with neo and fix it if there really is a problem, and not just them not liking my neo.</div>
