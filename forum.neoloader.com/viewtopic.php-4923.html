				<div class="content">You don't need a clean install. and teh latest beta for the new management.<br><br>It is ok to gether unlimited peers, as there is no actuall way to limit how much peers we get, we cna only start dropping them, and thats couner productive.<br>Instead its reasonable to limit only the ammount of active connections.<br>The behavioure is as already said the same as utorrent has.<br><br>A queue system is not needed for it to work ok eider.<br><br>So it showed 4% but the file was completed in incomming?<br>If it crashes and shows much les% after restart it should rehash the file and find already finished but forgoten parts.<br><br>Can you reproduce the oncomplete crash.</div>

				<div class="content">No, in uTorrent the peers are listed between () only if trackers are active, else it shows only the one that had a connection with us. You're talking about memory usage problem with flags, and I claim for memory usage problem with a very long peer list that is much more counter productive.<br><br>Yes, a queque system is needed, this screenshot was with only 1 torrent active... do you image what crap will happen with 2 ? That's why is avaible in uT and that's why we need it.<br><br>The file in incoming was corrupted. At restart it was redownloading it.<br>I don't know if I can reproduce it and I hope not. Even after cleaning manually the filelist.xml I got this error<br><blockquote class="uncited"><div>15 <img class="smilies" src="./images/smilies/17.gif" alt=":17:" title="17"> 45: Opening from Command Line 'C:\Users\Davide\AppData\Local\Temp\xxx.torrent'<br>15 <img class="smilies" src="./images/smilies/17.gif" alt=":17:" title="17"> 59: Incomplete File xxx was modifyed and is being rehashed<br>15 <img class="smilies" src="./images/smilies/17.gif" alt=":17:" title="17"> 59: Incomplete File xxx was modifyed and is being rehashed</div></blockquote><br><br>You still not exaplained the new values under avaibility columm, and you did not said this change in the changelog too....</div>

				<div class="content">Currently Connected peers / Total unique Peers we head a connection to / Total found peers <br><br>utorrent does not show the full list of peers it knows,<br>you can only switch bwteeen peers we are downloading form or all connected peers.<br><br>But it keeps all peers it knows in memory, also this is not so much data, you need the IP and a few status flags.<br><br>NeoLoader does this also in a simmilar way, a inactive a.k.a. not connected peer uses only a very littel of memory, and if a connection to that peer is established an auxyliary client object is created that has all the things needed to operate a peer that take all the memory.<br><br>PS: what value do you have under "Max Connections per File" inthe rottent panel?<br>should be 50, if its not its a bug with default config<br><br>David X.</div>

				<div class="content">So you have set 50 max connections per torrent and only one torrent active and get &gt;&gt; 50 active connections, that will be most likely doe to incomming connections that are not limited on a per torrent basis.<br><br>PS: to say somethign ybout your to much overhead issue i need a SS with verbode Graphs enabled witl all that many lines.<br>There is nothign that can be done ab out IP ACK overhead.<br>Other clients dont measure it an dont limit it. Your ISP may also count it separatly, <br>try dissable ACK limitation and see if thany ou can reache full download speed.</div>

				<div class="content">My upload speed is already sature, remove the ack limiting will cause more damage. After some restarts, I don't see any changes before and later the connection managment changes between the 2 latest beta versions, I just got more confusing avaibility columm.<br><br><strong>EDIT:</strong> After how many time it re-check for FW status? Can you add a manual recheck button in beta for tests only?<br><br><strong>EDIT:</strong> Verbose where I don't understand nothing <a href="mHVPV8P.jpg" class="postlink">http://i.imgur.com/mHVPV8P.jpg</a><br><br>We should be able to count in-out connection in non-verbose graph I think...</div>
