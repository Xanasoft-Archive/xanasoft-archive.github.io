Would you  see Neoloader become like NeoMule?</div></blockquote><br>Yes!!<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>abel wrote:</cite>My vision is to keep, as much as possible, the user away from the settings, because the average user each time that goes into setting think that, clicking randomly buttons, they will get some benefit or boost.<br>The user should, instead , start NeoLoader and feel that is already running and perfectly working, without touching anything. <img class="smilies" src="./images/smilies/smile.png" alt=":)" title=":)"> </div></blockquote><br>It doesn't mean that we can't add a switchable settings for country flag, they don't use a lot of CPU, will stay off by default, and who want them can activate. I like them because they makes UI more "eye friendly" then a ITA-ESP-GER...<br><br>p.s. As said in 1st post, is not a priority.</div>

Many eMule mods in fact got this feature.<br><br>Also uT had it. The memory usage for those small flag icons is really irrelevant.</div>

				<div class="content">for handling this type of request, i  suggested a different mode: <a href="http://board.neoloader.com/feature-requests/3361-slider-gui-requests.html#post16953" class="postlink">http://board.neoloader.com/feature-requests/3361-slider-gui-requests.html#post16953</a><br><br><br>For this request, one solution would be to turn on the column of the Country only to the user "Advanced / Developer", and show a string or a flag icon depending on the slider position.<br>I see no inconsistency with this solution.<br><br>;-)</div>
