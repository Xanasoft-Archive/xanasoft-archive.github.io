				<div class="content"><span style="font-size: 120%; line-height: normal">I just found this program tonight and am giving it a try. On Windows 7 64-bit 1080p resolution through a 32&quot; screen. Text is TINY! Also it is jammed together strangely in the lists of torrents or search results or whatever, as well as cut off at the bottom.<br><br>I would like to increase the text size or the UI size overall through DPI. But if I can't do that I would at least like to put some space between items in the lists.<br><br>Thank you for this awesome program!</span></div>

				<div class="content">i &quot;fixed&quot; this by hiding last filenames' part (resizing column width), removing type (before filename u have icon andthey quite rappresent file type), status ( there is a separate window for each status started paused stopped so... this could be avoided too), availability (i removed this column long time ago, and i never really missed it).<br><br>in order to remove a column just richtclick on &quot;File Name&quot; or any other column label and unflag non necessary labels.<br><br>i guess this will help you , at least, for now.</div>

Then we have to find a solution to make it work properly with different DPI settings <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
