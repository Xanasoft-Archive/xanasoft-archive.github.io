				<div class="content">I got rather behind on my updates ( <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes"> ), and am still running 0.41f. Do I need to do anything before installing 0.52 to keep the progress I currently have on some large files, or will this happen seamlessly?<br><br>Thanks in advance.</div>

				<div class="content">First of all, start making a <strong>backup</strong> copy of your NeoLoader folder, expecially the <strong>config folder</strong> that in the version 0.41f should be under the NeoLoader's one <span style="text-decoration: underline">is really important</span>, and your <strong>Temp/Incoming folders</strong>.<br><br>I do not remember if there's the auto updater into the 0.41f, if so, when you did the backup try to auto-update it running NeoSetup.exe (it should be inside NeoLoader folder). <br>If this feature was not avaible, sorry I don't remember (if there's not NeoSetup.exe, it's not... but it should be avaible I remember it got added at the very beginning) make a clean installation, set the previus incoming/temp folders and copy the filelist.xml into the new installation.<br><br>Sorry if this post is too chaotic, I replied quickly because I am busy.</div>

				<div class="content">Emm.... neo loader updates are intended to be incremental, so code to import very old files is being successfully removed after a few months/years.<br><br>you should definetly do a full backup of your current configuraiton and than try to do a clean install and than move your filelist.xml and the NeoCore.ini file to the new installation.</div>

				<div class="content">mhhh... I think there were a lot of changes in the neocore from the 0.41, since he's doing a clean install I think is better to not copy it. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Make a backup</span>, but personally I would try to choose manually the Incoming-Temp directories during the new installation and then copy the filelist.xml, restart and check if everything is working. If not, try to re-install copying both neoloader.ini and filelist.xml before the first startup.<br><br>I would avoid to use the old neocore to avoid strange/uncommon problems due to the new settings that was not avaible in 0.41.</div>
