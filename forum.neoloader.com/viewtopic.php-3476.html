If other players doesn't support that kind of stream or if they crash reproducing a file that is not complete yet is not a big deal, get VLC or use the built in player. Actually the time is limited and we should focus on other things instead of support many players...</div>

(did not mater if 1 PC or 2 PC's as long as they booth ware behind the same NAT)<br>Repeating the test with the LAN IP worked just fine.<br><br>Long Story short: its a routing problem of the NAT not a Neo specific issue I think.<br><br>Whan tappens if you repeat the test with 2 eMules? it should fail as well....</div>
