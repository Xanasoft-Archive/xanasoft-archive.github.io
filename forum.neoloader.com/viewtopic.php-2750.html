<br>In my case, that's ~37000 files and 11TB of data.</div>

<br>
<br>Primarily ed2k/Kad, but "all" is a good long-term target.
<br>
<br>I'm running on Linux, with the main system daemon-only.
<br>
<br>Amule runs but has trouble with the numbers but takes about an hour to fully share everything.
<br>
<br>Mldonkey runs fine and has the same problem as amule at startup. When adding files it can take 6-12 hours to notice and start advertising them - that's because the way it scans directories it can take several passes to pick up everything.
<br>
<br>Both programs have memory footprints of about 2Gb and neither uses very much CPU (the system ~ 8 year old dual 2.1GHz 5140 Xeon server.)</div>
