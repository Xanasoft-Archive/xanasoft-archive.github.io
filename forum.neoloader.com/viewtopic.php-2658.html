				<div class="content">the question is not "<strong>what </strong>to choose in the wizard," but "<strong>if </strong>choose in the wizard."<br>In 1st wizard these choices do not make sense, because the user will not know the difference between the choices. Provide a choice "masked" by simple voice "Low / Medium / High" with default in the midlle is an acceptable trade-off, because the user can get to make the right choice without knowing anything about what happens under the hood (SUI, Tracker, userhash, etc.), or he can leave the default choice.<br>If the most experienced user does not want the SUI and does not want the tracker, he can disable in the settings. But the Wizards is for newbies. <img class="smilies" src="./images/smilies/wink.png" alt=";)" title=";)"></div>

				<div class="content">No you would still find sources just did not successfully connect to them, as you explained it you dont get anything at all, also such a ban is gone after 2 h so your client should unstuck after 2h or break or running.</div>
