				<div class="content">It does not prevent software exploits from working, in most instances, unless that exploit required resources that are not available within the sandbox. If a given library is vulnerable, access to it can be blocked by the user, via adding some dismissive access rules. Though it is unclear what the application does if it fails to load a library as its function is not available.<br>
<br>
If a software in a sandbox is being exploited it is contained within that sandbox, unless the sandbox is configured to allow files being written outside the box, or if someone finds a way to exploit Sandboxie.</div>

				<div class="content">It's obviously still to be recommended to update software as soon as they are provided.<br>
<br>
To anyone coming across this topic, it is not only relevant if the box is configured to allow for files to be written outside the box, but also if breakout processes or folders (any breakout setting) are being set. Like if I use a download tool that I run under Sandboxie's control, but have set an image viewer to break out, so that is not covered by Sandboxie (unless that is forced into another box). If the image viewer is vulnerable, I am vulnerable, as I allow it to run unsandboxed.</div>
