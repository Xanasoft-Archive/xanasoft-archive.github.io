				<h3>&quot;Lifetime&quot; licenses honored?</h3>

				<div class="content">Hi,<br>
<br>
I have recently noticed that Sandboxie started to ask its users to purchase one of the certificates. I was paying for Sandboxie since when it first became "payware" and eventually purchased the "Lifetime" license. Given that there's still a little bit of life left in me, I'd like to ask if these "Lifetime" licenses are going to be honored or not? I can supply both the old product key and/or the Cleverbridge invoice. I have a few folks in their late 70s and 80s around me whom I helped to install/purchase Sandboxie, maybe some of them could still locate the invoices too.<br>
<br>
Thank you</div>

<br>
I'm not invincia and am in no way a legal successor of them,<br>
I'm just the only bloke on the internet with the required skill and enough free time on my hands to continue the project.<br>
If you want to use premium features without re-compiling your own build, you will have to buy a new supporter certificate to use my signed builds with the premium features.<br>
Also please note that all new premium features are new and invented by me. <br>
What got unlocked by the old Sandboxie licenses (multiple sandboxes, and force processes) is now available in the free version by default. <br>
<br>
Cheers<br>
