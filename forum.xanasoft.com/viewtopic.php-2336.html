				<div class="content">Please reconsider what licensing you are offering. Please consider perpetual version licenses. <br>
<br>
I'm sorry but I hate software as a service licensing models and I will never ever register any product requires a time limited license... sorry. <br>
<br>
Perpetual licensing gives the user the flexibility to stay on an old version (with less functionality) if they can't afford to upgrade or choose not to.<br>
<br>
I suspect like me you will force more users away then you will have re-subscribe due to this licensing model.<br>
<br>
I would consider repurchases for per version licensing, but I absolutely will not be held hostage to time limited licenses.</div>

The only non-subscription license is 1000 EUR!</div>

				<div class="content">Look you will not get 100 years of support and new versions features and bug fixes for 40€ I think this is understandable.<br>
<br>
You can get the medium certificate for 40€ the version released at the date of the purchase plus all builds released within 1 year after the purchase.<br>
You can buy it and stick to it, don't update your windows and web browser and use it for the next 100+ years you will miss out on security and improvements though.<br>
Similar the large just that there you get 2 years of updates.<br>
<br>
This is not a subscription scheme its a regular, buy a version and use it forever... you want a substantially newer version, you need to buy an upgrade. <br>
<br>
<br>
The only subscription options are the small and business certificates, there you can not use even the the builds once the certificate expires.</div>
