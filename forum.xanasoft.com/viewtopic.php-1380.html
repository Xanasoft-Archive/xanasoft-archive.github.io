				<div class="content">Hello everyone.<br>
<br>
I wanted to try a certificate for a month to see if the extra features fit my needs, but I'm having a problem.<br>
<br>

<br>
This is what I get, even after adding my supporter certificate through the settings.<br>
I tried searching for anything relevant to this on Google but it looks like I'm the only one having this issue.<br>
Let me know if there's anything else I can provide. The e-mail associated with my Patreon is the same e-mail I used to register here.</div>

<br>
I don't know if Patreon or different types of certificates are structured differently, but it has to be pasted in there with all the characters. The user interface should tell you if the certificate isn't valid or that it has to be pasted into the dialog box completely. Therefore, the certificate.dat should have been created, and the input field of the support page should have a green background. (Please DO NOT screenshot that, without covering any of these details.)<br>
<br>
The <em class="text-italics">About Sandboxie-Plus</em> dialog in the help menu states: This copy of (...) is certified for: Name.</div>

Can confirm that the certificate.dat exists and I didn't have any problems this time<br>

I will reinstall Sandboxie and check for the certificate again.</div>

<br>
Nice that it works, now.<br>
<br>
Ad far as I know, the certificate should be valid as soon as they are sent out. David knows more about that since he added the certificate, that is required for some functions, to finance the project. If there would be a time in which the certificate can't be applied, it seems advisable to state this in the message with which the certificate is sent out.</div>

There is no online validation of certificates if you get one it should work out right.<br>
The only problem I know of is that new patreones need to wait sometimes some time before the server will recognize their email and send out a certificate.<br>
But that's an issue of getting one not of them working once got.</div>

I got the Patreon Supporter Certificate, but it only provides the user's name,date,type,software,updateket and UPDATEKEY.<br>
<br>
But the program requires me to enter the serial number, i can't find it.<br>
