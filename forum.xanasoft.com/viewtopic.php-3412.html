				<div class="content">I have an odd issue.<br>
i use normally sandboxie and everything works fine.<br>
The other day i've installed push2run, and i noticed that the browser in the sandbox started to crash every timr i was trying to close a tab. Mostly that, i think.<br>
At first i thought i messed up something so tried another browser, and another sandbox.<br>
Then i realized that the only difference form when all was working was that push2run was running.<br>
When i closed it..all got back working normally.<br>
So, i don't know what and how, those 2 software are messing up with eachother.<br>
I tried to run push2run inside a sandbox. All is working that way..but push2run can't do anything it is supposed to do.<br>
There is any solution?<br>
Windows 11<br>
Sandboxie plus 1.7.1</div>

				<div class="content">I think there is something that makes the giu of browser crashing.<br>
Tried on windows 10, and there all is fine.<br>
anyway...the workaround i found is to use the 32bit version of the browser, and it doesn't happen anymore.<br>
Just odd that it happens</div>
