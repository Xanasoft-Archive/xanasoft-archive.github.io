				<div class="content">I've successfully installed Exact Audio Copy into a sandbox, but when running it doesn't have access to the CD Rom, is there any way around this?<br>
<br>
I've tried setting a couple of options but without success:<br>
Make applications think they are running elevated<br>
Allow sandboxed programs to manage Hardware/Devices</div>

				<div class="content">I've just moved over from the last Sophos Sandboxie and wow, what a great effort; it feels much more refined already!<br>
The only problem I've encountered so far is when removing sandboxes. The 'SandMan' window pops up after the confirmation and stays there. 'Cancel' does nothing but using the Cross does close it, and the sandbox is gone.<br>
<br>
Is there any way I can grant CD ROM access to a sandboxed app (to read)?</div>

I'm trying to sandbox Exact Audio Copy but it doesn't see the disc in the drive, is there any way I can address that?</div>

				<div class="content">It should be able to read the disc, but apparently it is not. If that is still an issue with newer software, you may want to try to open access to the drive.<br>

<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>OpenFilePath=The path to the CD drive</code></pre></div>

or with<br>

<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>OpenPipePath=again the path to the drive</code></pre></div> if EAC is installed in the sandbox or the binary is located inside of it.</div>
