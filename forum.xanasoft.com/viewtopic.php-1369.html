				<div class="content">Hi everyone<br>
<br>
I have installed Sandboxie Plus v.1.11.2 (Certified version). It's wonderful program and I was used it earlier few years ago, when it's have different author. Now I started to use it again and it's much better. David has done great work to improve it.<br>
<br>
Problem description;<br>
My Windows 10 22H2 language settings are; Keyboard language Finnish, Country or region Finland and Regional format Finnish (Finland). Windows display language is English (United States), because I like to use everything with English language. I don't like Finnish translations and I always used my computers with English language.<br>
<br>
Now, almost everything of Sandboxie menus and settings is English, but some of command buttons is Finnish and App Templates Names is Finnish. This is little bit annoying. In Windows registry (SbieSvc), Sandboxie language is 1033 (=English).<br>
<br>
If I change Windows Regional format to English (United States) and stop &amp; start Sandboxie, everything is English language in Sandboxie. <br>
<br>
I wonder, if it possible to change Sandboxie language settings somehow? I would like to force it to use English language everywhere. I can't change Windows settings permanently, because it's change date and time format etc.. It would be nice, If Sandboxie have language menu or ini-settings, where you can select (and force) language, what you want to use.<br>

				<div class="content">You can set the preferred language in the settings.<br>
<br>
In the main window of Sandboxie-Plus, click on Options &gt; Global Settings.<br>
<br>
There you see General Config being opened with the General Options being selected. The first entry is called UI language. You can set it to another provided language you like, or "No Translation".</div>

				<div class="content">You are welcome. There are quite a lot of settings, although that one is on the first page, but it is still possible to miss some settings. The settings windows include a search field, where you can type a word to search for (in the language that has been set.)<br>
<br>
BTW, there is no translator for the Finnish language of Sandboxie-Plus. You may like to contribute or know someone who would like to do that.</div>

I don't think I know anyone who has experience with user interface translations. I don't think my own language skills are enough. English is not my native language. The terminology of the user interface is in a certain way established and a direct translation of a word from one language to another does not really work.<br>
<br>
Text above, I write using google translator. This line and my earlier messages, I write without help. I understand English pretty good when I read or hear it. I have much more trouble, when I write or speak it. As you can see, google handle translating much better <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" width="15" height="17" alt=":-)" title="Smile"></div>
