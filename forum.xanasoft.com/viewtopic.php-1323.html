				<div class="content">I've been trying for hours and cannot figure it out - I have a standard Xbox One wireless controller, and it works perfectly fine in every non-Steam game and most Steam games running under Sandboxie but for several Steam games (Starfield, Valheim, Sons of The Forest so far) the controller just doesn't work at all regardless of which security settings I use (tried Standard and Application Compartment presets)<br>
<br>
I can get Valheim to work by forcing SteamInput on in the game settings, but the other games don't seem to work this way - and I'd rather not have to worry about SteamInput in the first place and fix the issue.<br>
<br>
If anyone has any ideas or suggestions on how to debug the issue that would be amazing, thank you!</div>

				<div class="content">I am most likely not able to help you, but if someone might be able to help you, what version of Sandboxie (e.g. 1.12.3 64bit) are you using and what system (e.g. Windows 10 22H2 64bit) are you on?<br>
<br>
There are <a href="https://github.com/sandboxie-plus/Sandboxie/issues/2134#issuecomment-1215466315" class="postlink">options to debug Sandboxie</a>, which have to be enabled for Sandboxie-Plus, via the Sandboxie-Plus.ini<br>
<br>
You may attempt to <a href="https://github.com/sandboxie-plus/Sandboxie/issues/1515#issuecomment-1006408988" class="postlink">disable some hooks</a>.<br>

There are more users at <a href="https://github.com/sandboxie-plus/Sandboxie" class="postlink">GitHub</a>, and their technical insight might be helpful.</div>
