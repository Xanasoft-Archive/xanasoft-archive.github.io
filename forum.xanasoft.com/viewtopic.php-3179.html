				<h3>Unable to download files for immediate recovery</h3>

				<div class="content">Hello.  I recently downloaded the latest version of Sandboxie Plus in my Windows 11 computer.  I have had previous versions on my Windows 10 computer and I'm noticing that I am unable to download files for immediate recovery.  I have the option selected, but I get no prompting to save files in designated folders.  In fact, I am not able to select folders for immediate recovery (seems like the folder selection is to exclude folders from immediate recovery).  I have also selected folders to save files when the browser closes, but I would like to have the option to immediately recover the files while the browser session is still active.  Is there a setting to allow for immediate recovery?  Is it a paid feature?  Thank you for the assistance.</div>
