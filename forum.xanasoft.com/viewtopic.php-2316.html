				<h3>Virtual Cards?</h3>

				<div class="content">Hello, <br>
<br>
I tried to buy Sandboxie using a VirtualCard and it didn't work. I think, it's because if I click credit card it forces the payment through paypal first. And for some reason paypal doesn't take VirtualCards like they used to anymore. <br>
<br>
I just can't make a paypal account anymore. Nor do I want to because when I did they wouldn't let me login my account because they wouldn't reply to any of my support messages or questions. Until the day I wanted to cancel service.<br>
<br>
Please, I realize you are very busy. But can I implore you to consider adding more ways to pay for Sandboxie Plus. I really love this software. And I tell my friends and family to get it.<br>
<br>
I just can't get it for my self yet.</div>

				<div class="content">I'm sorry to hear that you were unable to purchase Sandboxie Plus using a virtual card, and that you had a negative experience with PayPal in the past. I can understand how frustrating this must be, especially given how much you enjoy using the software.</div>
