				<h3>[resolved as false positive] Version 1.12.3-64 Virus Total hit</h3>
				<div class="date">Posted: <strong>Mon Dec 04, 2023 9:37 am</strong></div>

				<div class="content">Hi!  I want to update to latest version of Sandboxie plus for win10 64 bit, and ran it through Virus Total.  <br>
<br>
One result was trojan downloader win32 generic.  Attached is the scan that shows that. <br>
<br>
I understand this may be a false positive, but I prefer to have clean scans for files I put on my pc.  <br>
<br>
Is it possible to get a download that would not cause this reading?  <br>
<br>
Thanks!</div>

				<div class="content">It is most likely a false positive. I am not sure, when there will be another final release. Probably only David can tell.<br>
<br>
No detection does not always mean that a file is clean, but at least there is a better feeling.<br>
<br>
There have been reports of hits on unsigned pre-releases. The build is properly signed, which in itself is not a valid reason to blindly trust some piece of software, but at least it could not have been modified after it was released. I expect the rate of hits to be higher if someone managed to place malware in this software bundle.<br>
<br>
You could wait a few days and check again, if the warning is gone. As malware samples are shared among the vendors they should be able to confirm it and the hits would increase if there is something fishy going on.<br>
<br>
You also could reach out to Ikarus, via e-mail fp[-a-t-]ikarus.at or false-positive[-a-t-]ikarus.at (The [-a-t-] need to be an at-sign [@] to see if they can confirm it to be a false positive.</div>

				<div class="content">Thank you for your reply.  You wrote the possibilities and things I could do to work on this.  I never knew about the things that you shared about what could happen as well.  I have not put any file on my pc that came back with a trojan result, though sometimes it's hard to wait for a clean result.<br>
<br>
Goodnite!</div>

				<div class="content">HI Bastik-1001<br>
<br>
I got this reply from Ikarus:<br>
<br>
<br>
"Dear Ladies and Gentlemen,<br>
Sehr geehrte Damen und Herren,<br>
<br>
Many thanks for the delivered file.<br>
<br>
***** false-positive *****<br>
<br>
The false positive was removed and should not occur any more after our next database update."<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Do you think I should wait until the trojan message is gone on scanning?  They said next database update it won't occur any more, but I don't know when they will update.<br>
<br>
Thank you for telling me how to contact the Virus scanners.    They're reply was so friendly and fast!</div>

				<div class="content">Signature updates vary from product to product, but usually it does not take long. For consumer products, some release several signature updates per day, others once per day. I don't know at which rate they are updated for VirusTotal where it is often not configured to be as close as what end users will see. They can be configured to be more aggressive on VirusTotal, as a false positive is nearly harmless, compared to dozens or hundreds or even thousands of complaints if a product raises too many false alarms or even deletes legitimate files.<br>
<br>
I checked, before typing the reply, which is far later than you asked to wait for the flag to be cleared, and now there are no more reports for the file in question. Edit: If they confirmed something to be a false positive, there would have been little reason to wait, in my opinion.<br>
<br>
It's very nice that they reacted so promptly and that they were so kind to you.</div>

				<div class="content">They probably want to ensure that everything runs smoothly, and the faster they handle things, the less reports they get. No problem. I am glad that I could be helpful and that this was resolved.<br>
<br>
I edited the title.</div>
