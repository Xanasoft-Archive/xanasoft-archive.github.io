go to "Advanced Options" and enable:<br>
"Emulate sandboxed window station for all processes"<br>
hit ok or apply and try again,<br>
that may fix the issue</div>

I am new to this game, and I must tell you that making money is a great issue for me. I mean, maybe it is because I am new to the game and don't yet know everything about it, or maybe I am just a bad player. However, I must say that even if I get more money, I spend it fast, just like in real life. I have this issue with spending a lot of cash. Last month, I played a lot of blackjack at <a href="https://onlinecasinobuddy.com/casino/pelaa-casino-review/" class="postlink">Pelaa Casino</a>; initially, I was winning everything. At last, I lost everything I had won.</div>

				<div class="content">I am an experienced casino player, so I have many recommendations for you. Here are some tips when looking for an online casino. Look for casinos that are licensed and regulated by reputable authorities, such as the UK Gambling Commission, the Malta Gaming Authority, or the Gibraltar Gambling Commission. It is important to choose casinos that offer a wide variety of games from reputable software providers.</div>
