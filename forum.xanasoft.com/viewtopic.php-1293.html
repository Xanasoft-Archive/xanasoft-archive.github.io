				<div class="content">This file creates the Sandboxie Service. As far as I can tell, there were <a href="https://github.com/sandboxie-plus/Sandboxie/commits/master/Sandboxie/core/svc" class="postlink">some changes</a> but I would not be able to tell what triggered this. David might be able to tell why this is the case.<br>
<br>
From which version did you update to which?<br>
<br>
Does F-Secure show, which process SbieSvc.exe was modifying or trying to modify?<br>
<br>
EDIT: SbieSvc.exe in itself does not raise any flags on <a href="https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/24c5d41136b7531637557db3537856220a35ab3f7a8ec55c908a97cc4d0b2225" class="postlink">VirusTotal</a>.</div>

				<div class="content">Unfortunately, F-Secure doesn't spill the details on which process the blocked file was trying to mess with. The exact reason for the block is a bit hazy, and right now, I can't find a detailed log file that breaks it down further.</div>

				<div class="content">They probably analyzed the sample and did not see a reason to block the file. There have been new releases since then.</div>
