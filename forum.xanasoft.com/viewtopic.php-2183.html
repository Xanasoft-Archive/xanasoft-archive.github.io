				<div class="content">I am playing a game and found a modifier online that is easy to use. It adds a crosshair to the center of the screen and enhances some user interface elements. However, I am concerned that the modifier might contain a virus, so I attempted to run it in a sandbox. Unfortunately, my game failed to run in the sandbox due to compatibility issues. Therefore, the modifier is running in the sandbox, while the game is running outside of it.<br>
<br>
Currently, the modifier is able to launch successfully, but it does not seem to have any effect (I have confirmed that it can work). I have attempted to change some settings, such as allowing sandboxed programs to access external memory, but have been unsuccessful. I am wondering if there is a way to configure the sandbox so that a specific program within it can read and write the memory of a specific process outside of the sandbox.<br>
<br>
In summary, I would like to know if there is a configuration that allows a program within the sandbox to read and write the memory of a specific process outside of the sandbox.</div>

				<div class="content">I can't help you with your problem, but you might be able to make your case work with the proper resource access configuration. <a href="https://sandboxie-plus.github.io/sandboxie-docs/Content/ResourceAccess.html" class="postlink">Here is an overview.</a><br>

<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>ReadIpcPath=$:program.exe</code></pre></div> allows a sandboxed process to read the memory of "program.exe".
<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>ReadIpcPath=$:*</code></pre></div> allows a sandboxed process to read the memory of any process.<br>

<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>OpenIpcPath=$:program.exe</code></pre></div> allows read and write access to the memory of "program.exe".</div>
