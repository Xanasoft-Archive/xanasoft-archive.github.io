				<div class="content">Hello, <br>
<br>
I dont know when someone will read this, but i need help uninstalling sandboxie. I was told that this would be a good alternative to windows sandbox but it does not really work for me. <br>
<br>
I cant uninstall it through the regular methods and there doesn't seem to be a uninstall file in the system files. The KmdUtil file give me "missing command" error <br>
<br>
Can someone guide me in removing v1.9.6 from my win11 system?</div>

				<div class="content">It might not be worth your time to report on why it did not work for you, so I skip guessing or directly asking why that is the case for you.<br>
<br>
Now to your problem.<br>
<br>
It should work with the Windows internal procedure, but apparently that does not work for you.<br>
<br>
Please try to uninstall it in a different way:<br>
1) Although it should not be required, end the process Sandman.exe<br>
2) Run "C:\Program Files\Sandboxie-Plus\unins000.exe" it should ask for admin rights which you have to grant<br>
3) Select that you want to uninstall it<br>
4) Choose if you want to keep the configuration AND/OR sandboxes (probably not, in your case.) WARNING: Files stored in sandboxes, will be removed with them.</div>
