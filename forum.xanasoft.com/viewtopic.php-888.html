				<div class="content">Hello,<br>
<br>
there is no team behind Sandboxie-Plus. David is the lead developer and there are some contributions made by others. So only David is the one who made a decision about it. He has stated that to be not the case <a href="viewtopic.php-758.html?f=12&amp;t=443" class="postlink">here</a> and <a href="viewtopic.php-891.html?f=14&amp;t=553" class="postlink">here</a>. On GitHub, he stated not having access to the list of previous users and thereby being unable to verify it, even if he was going to be willing. He's not the legal successor.<br>
<br>
Ronen Tzur sold to Invincea Inc. who sold to the Sophos Group, who before discontinuing the project released the source code. This code was forked and Sandboxie-Plus was created by David. This is not the continuation of the original project.<br>
<br>
Everything users had to use the old license for could and can be used free-of-charge after the open-source release, as long as that was within the code. This includes the use of being able to force programs into sandboxes and have practically unlimited sandboxes.<br>
<br>
Sandboxie-Plus and Classic work fine without the need to spend money. After some period of time, it shows a support reminder, which appears once a month, before that gets down to once every five days. This won't get shown with a valid certificate. I had <a href="https://github.com/sandboxie-plus/Sandboxie/issues/2929" class="postlink">the idea to have a certificate that only suppresses the reminder</a>, which has not been done, yet, but might be considered as the idea was not rejected, yet.<br>
<br>
All features that require a certificate were newly introduced by David.<br>
<br>
There are <a href="https://github.com/sandboxie-plus/Sandboxie/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md" class="postlink">various ways to obtain a certificate</a>.</div>
