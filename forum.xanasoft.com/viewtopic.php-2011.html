				<div class="content">Hi.  I saw in the forum that Sandboxie Plus 1.97 was released about a month ago, but it is not on: <a href="https://sandboxie-plus.com/downloads" class="postlink">https://sandboxie-plus.com/downloads</a>.<br>
<br>
My 1.96 version that I've had for a while, has had a strange thing happen today, and so I uninstalled completely, and reinstalled 1.96 and all is working okay for now.<br>
<br>
Is there a way to get the latest plus release?  I am unable to get anything from Github as am not technically knowledgeable about using that site.<br>
<br>
If there is anything I need to do to be able to be able to get the latest releases please let me know.<br>
<br>
Thank you so much!</div>

				<div class="content">Hello, the releases on the main website are purposefully lagging behind to catch if something is wrong with them, but it's unclear to how far it is supposed to lag behind.<br>
<br>
As of now, the forum announcements only list final releases, which I think is a good thing, as not everyone is interested in pre-releases. Curiously enough, 1.9.7 has been followed by another stable release namely 1.9.8, which has not been announced here.<br>
<br>
The releases are hosted on Github, anyway. The announcement for 1.9.7 links to<br>
(<a href="" class="postlink">https://github.com/sandboxie-plus/Sandboxie/releases/tag/v1.9.7</a>),<br>
while the latest stable is 1.9.8 (at the time of writing, released 21st June 2023)<br>
(<a href="https://github.com/sandboxie-plus/Sandboxie/releases/tag/v1.9.8" class="postlink">https://github.com/sandboxie-plus/Sandboxie/releases/tag/v1.9.8</a>)<br>
<br>
Following the latest link shows a page, where users can select the version they need for their system. In most instances, that will be Sandboxie-Plus-x64-v1.9.8.exe, since it is expected that they have a 64bit system. (x86 is for 32bit systems, while ARM64 is a different architecture)<br>
<br>
However, there should be no need to visit a website to update to the latest version, unless you want to install it all over again. Within the user-interface, you can select "Help" and then click on "Check for Updates". Starting with 1.9.7, you can add an icon to the toolbar for that function. In the main options of Sandboxie-Plus' user-interface, you can enable to search for updates regularly. It is even possible to select which versions you prefer, like stable or preview. In your case, that should be the stable versions. One is also able to configure the workflow of updates, like only notifying or downloading an update for you. Upcoming releases, including 1.10.x will provide a selection of intervals, for how often to check for updates.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi!  Thank you so much for your reply.  It said I would get an email when it posted and I didn't get one, so I didn't notice till just today that you had posted.<br>
<br>
I saw the update and downloaded it and appreciate it so much.  The reason I never download from GitHub was because way back when Sandboxie was no longer with Sophos, GitHub would have the first new release, but not in a form that I could use.  It had numerous parts to it, and I had no idea what to do with it, but after your post here, I went to the link you gave at GitHub and saw that now it downloads the full and all ready put together program.<br>
<br>
Thank you also for explaining the check for update and how I can prefer the stable version.<br>
<br>
I will make another post in the forum here and will do that soon.<br>
<br>
I appreciate your help!</div>

				<div class="content">You are welcome! That might be a bug in the forum software, a misconfiguration, or sending e-mails is not enabled. I have no overview over settings. David will have to look into this. There are things that don't work, like it being impossible to report posts.<br>
<br>
The first thing might have been just the sources. Some projects host just the code/the source on places like Github and distribute their releases in some other way. For Sandboxie-Plus you can find the code and the releases on Github. Download links are provided on the main website as well.</div>
