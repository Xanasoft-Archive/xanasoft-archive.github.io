				<div class="content">I was able to fix by downloading latest release (v1.3.5) from github. ( <a href="https://github.com/sandboxie-plus/Sandboxie/releases/" class="postlink">https://github.com/sandboxie-plus/Sandboxie/releases/</a> )<br>
Strange thing is that when I clicked on "Check for Updates" inside SandBoxie, I was told that v1.3.2 is the latest release.</div>

				<h3>Re: Firefox keeps showing SBIE2327 error</h3>

				<div class="content">I'm getting a very similar problem with the new Sandboxie+ (v1.5.0) which I installed hoping it would correct the same problem with a much earlier version of Sandboxie+. Unfortunately it didn't fix it.<br>
I'm getting SBIE2327 Error in COM Server when I start Firefox Nightly 107.01a1 and several times after it starts. I will point out that Firefox does not crash. What is the consequence of this error? Can this cause any problems with security?<br>
<br>
I remember problems occurring with Browsers in the original Sandboxie which was made by the people before Sophos purchased it. That was because of the inbuilt browser sandbox which conflicted with Sandboxie. Changing the browser inbuilt Sandbox setting to a lower level eliminated the error in those earlier sandboxie old classic versions.</div>

Sandboxie Plus still shows the same three notifications when Firefox Nightly starts. I have rebooted and it is the same as it was before I rebooted.<br>
