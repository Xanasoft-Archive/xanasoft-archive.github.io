				<div class="content">Appreciate you releasing the tools. I have used computers since I was 12 with no viruses. Always buily my own desktops but recently... I fished it up and bought a dell with windows 10. <br>
<br>
It worked fine for 1.5 years (had to replace screen once. Power jack 3 times.)
<ul>
<li>In March windows update broke my machine... it wont restart, finally get it to load and explorer wont let me open folders or basic things...</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>I leave for France to visit gf's family and get some time off. (started a site that was doing well and I felt like I couldnt take day off).  So my first days off in months...  Windows + Dell Update = Encrypted Hard Drive and no Key... Thats level 8/10 worst case scenario for a virus lol.... and I had the pleasure of paying for it.</li>

</ul>

<ul>
<li>Cut my trip short since I can't log-in to anything and my backups are on external drives back home. Install windows again, turn off all bios updates... breaks again haha</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>4th time 3 days later.</li>
</ul>

 So here I am.  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_e_confused.gif" width="15" height="17" alt=":?" title="Confused">  <br>
<br>
 As gross as it is... been using a 2013 windows 8 machine with no problems. I forgot how sweet it is to hit the power button and than see the machine just power down. Thank you.</div>
