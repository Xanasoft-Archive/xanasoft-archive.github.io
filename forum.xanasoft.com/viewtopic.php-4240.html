				<div class="content">Hello,<br>
<br>
Sandboxie stopped working for me and nothing I ran in it worked.<br>
<br>
So I uninstalled it and did a fresh install but stuff still did not work.<br>
<br>
I again uninstalled it and went to c: drive.<br>
<br>
I tried to delete the Sandboxie folder but I cant.<br>
When I open it and open it I see firefox in the folder.<br>
<br>
I cant take ownership of any of the folders even thou I am admin and even tried in command prompt.<br>
I tried removing the attrib read only and that did not work either.<br>
I even tried from powershell as admin and that does not work either.<br>
Starting in safe mode also does not help to delete the folders and program in them.<br>
<br>
How can I remove the folder "Sandbox" and all its sub folders from c: drive?<br>
I want to install Sandboxie again but as long as those folders are lock and have stuff in them sandboxie will not work.<br>
<br>
<br>
Thanks in advance<br>
Vashta</div>
