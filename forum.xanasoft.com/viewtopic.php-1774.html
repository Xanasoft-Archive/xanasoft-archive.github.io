				<h3>&quot;DiskCryptor&quot; error 04</h3>

				<div class="content">Good evening everyone from italy.<br>
(sorry for translation errors)<br>
<br>
I have a big problem with a 4Tb disk encrypted with "DiskCryptor"<br>
I encrypted a 4tb HDD using standard DiskCryptor settings.<br>
I did not create a "keyfile", because if I used the key plus the password I had an error, so I only used the password.<br>
the disk worked fine for about a year (still on the same PC).<br>
then I had to move the disk to another PC where I installed the same version of DiskCryptor.<br>
it worked<br>
<br>
as soon as I returned the disk to the original pc, I received error 04 (incorrect password)<br>
The password is correct as it is written in a text file.<br>
<br>
i tried to encrypt a second hdd, using same password and without keyfile.<br>
the disk has been encrypted, mounted correctly, but as soon as it is unmounted and remounted, it returns error 04<br>
so, before he worked using only the password, now he needs the keyfile to mount a disk.<br>
<br>
provided that I have an identical hdd that I can use as a backup.<br>
Is there any way to recover the data and the disk?<br>
maybe using the program's PGP key ID?<br>
using truecript, it detects that the disk has been encrypted with the veracrytp / truecrypt method<br>
if I do a bit / bit clone can I work on the second disk, or is it conditioned by the volume code?<br>
<br>
I have tried several recovery tools but they don't work.<br>
I started a testdisk session, interrupted almost immediately due to the size of the disk (estimated time 15 days)<br>
I am open to all suggestions<br>
<br>
Thank you</div>

				<div class="content">I found these indications. <br>
How do I fix the "volume header" not having a backup? <br>
(it's an external data disk).<br>

<br>
You can of cause clone the disk and work on the copy</div>

				<div class="content">Thanks for the reply.<br>
I have already made a copy (claster) with the same support.<br>
I saw that opening the diskcryoptor program, rightly, assigns two different codes to the volumes.<br>
I hope this has no consequence in the disk encryption phase.<br>
Do you know, or do you suggest me, any program or tool for restoring encrypted discs? (if you can)<br>
I tested about 10 suggested on the net (free or demo), but without results.<br>
the disk has two partitions, one free of 50 mb and the other encrypted.<br>
the tools see me only the data of the free one.<br>
<br>
testdisk update: if I start testdisk, doing a rough calculation, it estimates a time of about 37 days to test all disk.<br>
and I don't know if it can help or I'm just wasting time.</div>
