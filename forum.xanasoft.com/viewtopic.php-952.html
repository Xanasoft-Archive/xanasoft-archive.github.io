				<div class="content">Greetings! <br>
<br>
I'm interested in supporting this application, as I think it's interesting and I enjoy using it. However, I have the following questions:<br>
<br>
I tried looking at the feature comparison and noticed that it mentioned that liscenses seem to expire. However, on some pages, it says that liscenses never expire at the same time. I was a bit confused by the conflicting information.<br>
<br>
In addition, are there any major differences between the $15 Advanded Upgrade vs the $40 Personal liscense?<br>
<br>
I was planning on getting the $40 personal liscense but I'm still just not sure.<br>
<br>
Thanks in advanced, and apologies if this has been asked before.</div>

<br>
Here is an <a href="https://sandboxie-plus.com/feature-comparison/" class="postlink">overview</a>.<br>
<br>
The upgrade license, however, is a very recent change. This apparently unlocks features that are not covered by "standard" licenses. For the time being, that should be the encrypted box type. You will need a license before you can apply the upgrade license. In this instance, that means paying 40 and 15 dollar. Unless I misunderstand the terms. I let David explain the different licenses, he changed recently, to inform you about which license covers what and how long it will last.<br>
<br>
Most of the licenses are valid for a year, in most instances a year of usage. In case of the personal license, it will work for the version you bought it for and cover updates that are released within a year. Those will remain functional with everything the license covers, but if you want to use a newer version of Sandboxie-Plus, you will need to re-new the certificate.</div>

				<div class="content">The feature comparisons page already posted explains it mostly already.<br>
<br>
The confusion about the expiration of Personal (formally Medium) certificates stems from how they work, <br>
The certificate is valid for the current build and any build released less than 1 year from the date of issuance.<br>
For those builds it will never expire with regard to unlocked functionality.<br>
<br>
They will however expire in the sense as they won't be valid for a build released 1 year and 1 day from the date of issuance.<br>
<br>
Also, there is another aspect recently added in 1.10.0 the troubleshooting wizard which comes with a library of troubleshooting scripts will only download new scripts from the server when the certificate is not yet expired. Likewise, the new updater option to download the latest Compatibility templates will only work with a non expired certificate.<br>
<br>
I really should <br>
1. mentioned the new benefits on the webpage (these functionalities were not present in older builds at all) <br>
2. explain that it needs a non expired certificate to work<br>
<br>
Also for completeness there is the Eternal (formally huge) certificate which never expires, but it's ridiculously expensive.</div>

				<div class="content">Something that is not clear to me, is if the advanced certificate can be applied again.<br>
<br>
Let's say a user bought the family pack, which lasts for a year and the advanced certificate to use the ramdisk encryption feature. Of course, the family pack certificate has to be renewed, but can the already purchased advanced certificate be used with the renewed certificate? At least, that is what I get from the description. One needs a valid certificate to apply the advanced certificate to upgrade.</div>

				<div class="content">No not quite you can use the advanced upgrade on one certificate if you used it on the old one you can not re use it on a new one.<br>
I'll clarify this in the description, thank you for bringing this to my attention.</div>

				<div class="content">Since the advanced upgrade certificate is supposed to be single use, only, as per license, you might also want to clarify how and if they apply to the family pack.<br>
<br>
I am under the assumption that if one purchases the "Personal" certificate and the advanced upgrade, that this person can apply the personal certificate to all his devices AND apply the upgrade to all of them. For example, the user has an everyday PC, he uses the RAM disk encryption with and a backup PC that also should be used with that function, all with his personal certificate and ONE advanced upgrade certificate.<br>
<br>
Further, the word <em class="text-italics">pack</em>, on the advanced upgrade license, suggests that it can be used as a pack with the family pack. One buys a family pack license and ONE advanced upgrade license, and could be able to upgrade all family computers.  You could clarify if that is the case.<br>
<br>
Business use-cases seem to be clear since they need a business certificate for each seat, and the upgrade is single use only, so it seems to imply that each of them needs to be upgraded with an individual advanced upgrade certificate.</div>

				<div class="content">If the advanced encryption upgrade applies for 1 seat or for multiple depends on the certificate type being upgraded.<br>
When you upgrade a business cert you need one advanced upgrade per PC,<br>
When you upgrade a personal, subscription, or family pack you only need one upgrade key for all the PC's<br>
<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>I am under the assumption that if one purchases the "Personal" certificate and the advanced upgrade, that this person can apply the personal certificate to all his devices AND apply the upgrade to all of them.</div></blockquote>
This is correct.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Further, the word pack, on the advanced upgrade license, suggests that it can be used as a pack with the family pack. One buys a family pack license and ONE advanced upgrade license, and could be able to upgrade all family computers. You could clarify if that is the case.</div></blockquote>
This is the case.<br>
<br>
<br>
The way the mechanism works is: when you enter a upgrade key the UI sends a cert request to the server providing the update key from the installed cert and the serial number. The server validates if the serial number exists, and checks if for this serial number a certificate was already created, if it was it just returns the created certificate as is, if it was not it retrieves the original cert by its update key and generates an upgraded certificate which is then stored and returned<br>
<br>
So for the first family PC the key is entered the server will generate an advanced cert for any subsequent PC it will just return the already made one, <br>
so you can just as well simply copy the upgraded cert from the first PC and enter it directly on any new family PC.</div>

				<div class="content">I know, some will disagree, but this appears to be reasonable for a lot of people, minus those that inhabit poorer regions of the world. And those still can use quite a lot of features for free.<br>
<br>
Anyone can use Sandboxie Plus for their personal needs for free; just if they want to use advanced features, they either need to buy the certificate for the current version plus updates for a year and use those, or supply themselves and their family with a certificate for a year, which they will have to renew, but can be used by more people. And if one needs very advanced features, they need to spend a bit more money.<br>
<br>
Parts of that can be done by other means, like using system encryption or storing the files with an encrypted storage solution, putting something on a RAM disk, etc., and only lack some comfort or other features. So it is not something that people should feel the need to complain about.<br>
<br>
Thank you for detailing the conditions and for the clarification.</div>
