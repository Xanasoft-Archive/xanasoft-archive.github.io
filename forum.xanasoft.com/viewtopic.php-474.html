<br>
I am building a system again, and just realized I hadn't updated my PrivateWin10 in ages and stopped by to get the latest version. Thank you for making .85. But now we have 22H2 as the "final" version of Win10, and of course there's Win11 too. Have you considered further development on Priv10? or is there a Priv11 being considered (for the future - right now I still only use Win10 and several flavors of linux)? I consider your tool well made and a must have, as it is more granular than others (shows the exact methods to achieve each of the tweaks). You also have cred/reputation more trustworthy than foreign software developers. Do you consider .85 to still be sufficient to corral version 22H2? I hope it is because I prefer your tools. If not, do you have a recommended alternative?<br>
<br>
I realize that keeping up with Microsoft's shenanigans is an ongoing battle. And we all have lives too. Thanks again for your work David, it's appreciated greatly.</div>

				<div class="content">Apologies - I just found the announcement of MajorPrivacy after typing my post.<br>
<br>
A few thoughts that are related to development - I'm going to just think out loud for a moment.<br>

<ul><li>MP needs to retain the granular control options with explanations of methodology used (GPO, registry, etc).</li>
<li>It might be useful to create setting "Playbooks" for various scenarios (so to avoid activating a setting that would stop an essential program from running). Some scenarios might include "Microsoft Office user, Non Microsoft Office user, VR Gamer PC, Video/Media Production PC, Virtualization User (host/guest), Programmers PC"</li> 
<li>An option to run a "MajorPrivacy checkup" after microsoft forces an update, so that MP will detect any settings that broke or were reenabled by the update. Also, (would completely need to be an optional opt-in) it could be useful for users to send data on what sneaky settings microsoft adjusted on their PC by updates. Also, this would make good forum post content for the community. A link to the forum could be offered within MajorPrivacy.</li>

</ul>

And David, if you are going to beta test, let us know. Thank you for your work again.</div>
