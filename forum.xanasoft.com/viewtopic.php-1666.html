				<h3>Sandboxie wipes out Bluetooth</h3>

				<div class="content">It took me a long time to realise what was going on and after months of observations this has become clear that if I start the browser Sandboxie Plus will crash it and then create a blue screen. It will say there is a page fault in a non-paged area every time.<br>
Restarting is simple enough although it's a pain when in the middle of work and research.<br>
But the WORST is that Bluetooth is taken out. Every SIngle Time.<br>
I can't get it back. Downloading the drivers and reinstalling (it is completely wiped off the system and no longer visible in either drivers or even computer management) doesn't help.<br>
The only thing that helps is uninstalling Sandboxie Plus.<br>
That gives me Bluetooth back.<br>
<br>
Is there something I can do to prevent this from happening? I am at my wits end by now. It just happened again and I have lost all functionality of some Bluetooth devices which is a crying shame.</div>
