				<div class="content">currently trying to run multiple instances of diablo 2 resurrected. i have 2 separate folders for battle.net folders, 2 folders for D2R, 2 separate bnet logins, and 2 separate copies of D2R (cd keys)<br>
<br>
when i try to run one copy in sandboxie, i am able to join/create a game with both accts and everything seems to work correctly. if i was to try and move to a different act, the sandboxed copy of the game will freeze and crash.<br>
<br>
any help would be greatly appreciated and if someone needs any other info, please let me know!! <br>
<br>
thanks in advance!<br>
<br>
