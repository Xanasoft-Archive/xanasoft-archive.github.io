				<div class="content">Hello, <br>
<br>
I have been a sandboxie (paid user) from it's early beginning .<br>
<br>
From it's nature operation (and any software nature operation) ,  i always check who is the author standing behind a software . <br>
<br>
Since sandboxie switched owners , you " David Xanatos " as you call your persona , is hiding behind this persona .  <br>
<br>
Please give us , the users,  a more assuring  and more revealing entity, who stands behind the sandboxie management ?, <br>
<br>
So "I" ( and i am sure many others)  can move forward , and go ahead and install this software . <br>
<br>
I think you are doing a great job with sandboxie, and "I" ( as others ) is/are grateful for the efforts you give this software in order to be what it is . <br>
<br>
Releasing a paid version for sandboxie is also a way to make this software validity more assuring .</div>

				<div class="content">Hello,<br>
<br>
Well I don't appreciate random people on the internet knowing my private life identity, that is kind of well private.<br>
<br>
My online persona is well known since the early 2000's so IMHO its quite trustworthy <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" width="15" height="17" alt=";)" title="Wink"><br>
<br>
Anyhow the released binaries are signed by a Austrian company with an EV certificate, and they know who I am, that should be enough.<br>
<br>
Also since recently there is a paid version: <a href="https://xanasoft.com/shop/" class="postlink">https://xanasoft.com/shop/</a> it unlocks new functionality introduced in the 1.0.x builds.<br>
<br>
And it takes Paypal so no shady anonymous Crypto Coin stuff.<br>
<br>
Cheers<br>
David</div>
