Is there a parameter I can pass to make this happen, or would I have to submit a feature request?</div>

Sandboxie-Plus 1.11.2 got options inside the GUI to control what happens when the main window is closed, but this is not exactly what you are looking for.</div>

If I understood correctly the desired result, it should be possible to launch a program minimized by clicking a link set to "minimized" (in Property / Shortcut tab, "Run" settings). I tried it with a Sandboxie-Plus portable version and it worked. If you want it to happen every time Windows starts up, it should be enough to put that link in "startup" folder.<br>

Ah, thank you for that suggestion, but I don't think that will work. I'm hoping to minimize to system tray automatically, not just minimize to taskbar. The same behavior that when you click the 'x' in the gui, it will still be running but not visible on screen unless you open it from the systray icon.<br>
<br>
A lot of apps have a parameter allowing them to start silently, but sandboxie doesn't seem to.</div>

				<div class="content">It seems I managed to obtain what you want using this .vbs script (I just wrote it in a notepad and changed the file extension)<br>
<br>
set WshShell = WScript.CreateObject("WScript.Shell")<br>
WshShell.run("""C:\Program Files\Sandboxie-Plus\SandMan.exe""")<br>
WshShell.appactivate ("Sandboxie-Plus")<br>
WScript.Sleep(3000)<br>
WshShell.SendKeys "%{F4}"<br>
<br>
This should work, assuming that the Sandboxie directory is correct (line 2) and 3 seconds is enough to launch it (line 4), otherwise you can adjust the script accordingly. The "appactivate" (line 3) should help avoid that alt+F4 is sent to any other already opened app; in case it's sent to Windows, it means you have to increase the waiting time in milliseconds in line 4.<br>
As said above, you can put this script in Startup folder, if you need to. Now I think Sandboxie shouldn't "try to get froggy" anymore (assuming I guessed correctly the reference in your alias).</div>

I appreciate your help here! I'm already calling it from powershell scripts, and didn't want to overly complicate things. I might take your idea though and reimplement it in powershell, thank you <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" width="15" height="17" alt=":)" title="Smile"><br>
<br>
And you absolutely guessed the reference from my alias correctly! I hate it when any program tries to get froggy lol!</div>
