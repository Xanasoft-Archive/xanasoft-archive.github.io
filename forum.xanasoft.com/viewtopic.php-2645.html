				<div class="content">Hi, I want to know how I can run two instances of the same app with different credentials and load a specific copy of a .dll for each of them (or at least set a working directory for the sandboxed app).<br>
<br>
To make it easy, I want to launch the same app twice and login with a different account, BUT they both must use their own copy of a .dll I modified in the base (working) directory from advanced.<br>
<br>
What I currently do is disable the mutex mechanism from the binary, and it launches two instances, but it doesn't seem to work after a certain screen. This is why I need to have it run in a virtualized environment.</div>

				<div class="content">You should be able to have two sandboxes with a copy of the program and the required .dll per sandbox. This means having two copies of everything, plus a different .dll for each instance.<br>
<br>
This should look like this:
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>C:\Sandbox\%USER%\%SANDBOXNAME<strong class="text-strong">A</strong>%\drive\C\Program Files\YOURPROGRAM\(full copy and .dll A)<br>
C:\Sandbox\%USER%\%SANDBOXNAME<strong class="text-strong">B</strong>%\drive\C\Program Files\YOURPROGRAM\(full copy and .dll B)</div></blockquote>

Alternatively, having the program installed into the system and start each instance in a different sandbox, where you place the different .dll in the path inside each box.<br>

<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>ProtectHostImages=y</code></pre></div> must not be set, when ProtectHostImages is active boxed .dlls are not supposed to be loaded for binaries outside the sandbox.<br>
<br>
That should look like follows:
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>C:\Program Files\YOURPROGRAM\<br>
C:\Sandbox\%USER%\%SANDBOXNAME<strong class="text-strong">A</strong>%\path to where .dll A needs to be<br>
C:\Sandbox\%USER%\%SANDBOXNAME<strong class="text-strong">B</strong>%\path to where .dll B needs to be</div></blockquote></div>

				<div class="content">Many thanks bastik, could you also tell me how do i permit everything (remove all restrictions) to an app and just make it stay virtualized? Also, how can i make sandboxie "remember" the files? i see the app keeps downloading the same resource files everytime i open it.</div>

				<div class="content">By default, the files downloaded into a sandbox should remain present, until they get deleted by an application (e.g. a download manager loads parts of a file, merges them into one file and deletes the parts), the user opts to clear the sandbox (or when the box gets removed), or when the box is set to autodelete.<br>
<br>
When
<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>AutoDelete=y</code></pre></div>
is set the contents of the box will be removed, when the last program in the box has terminated.<br>

David has added <a href="https://sandboxie-plus.com/compartment-mode/" class="postlink">app compartment boxes</a>, which require a supporter certificate. He has already written something about <a href="https://github.com/sandboxie-plus/Sandboxie/issues/1515" class="postlink">the least strict sandboxing</a>. There are also some <a href="https://github.com/sandboxie-plus/Sandboxie/issues/2134#issuecomment-1215466315" class="postlink">debug options</a>, which can reduce the restrictions. The user interface may warn you about certain debug options being set, so they are not used in productive use by accident.</div>
