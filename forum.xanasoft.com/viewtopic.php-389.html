				<div class="content">Hi,<br>
<br>
I'm experimenting with DiskCryptor and trying to understand whether it's possible to set up things so that there's external bootloader (e.g. on USB) that automatically decrypts drives on boot -- however I also want to have a 'fallback' (e.g. password) option in case that USB drive is not available.<br>
<br>
The usecase would be e.g. laptop -- while at home I'd prefer to have it auto-decrypt and while traveling it should require a password.<br>
<br>
As far as I can tell, using keyfiles doesn't let me to fallback to a password -- because it seems keyfile content is being hashed or something, so seems impossible to enter keyfile contents manually.<br>
<br>
There seems to be an &lt;AutoPassword&gt; option in the source code (DCAuthLoadConfig()), but when I tried to add it to DcsProp (on USB stick, and also AutoLogin=1) -- I get the 'incorrect password' message at startup and still have to enter the correct password manually.<br>
<br>
So is there a way to setup it so that it uses some kind of 'password' if it's available (on USB or w/e) and otherwise falls back to asking the user for the password?<br>
<br>
Thanks!</div>

				<div class="content">Turns out &lt;AutoPassword&gt; option works -- except there's a bug.<br>
<br>
The bug is that only half of the value of &lt;AutoPassword&gt; gets used (probably has something to do with wide-string conversion in the source code).<br>
<br>
The workaround is to enter your password twice into &lt;AutoPassword&gt; value.<br>
<br>
So it would be something like this:<br>
&lt;config key="AutoLogin"&gt;1&lt;/config&gt;<br>
&lt;config key="AutoPassword"&gt;[yourpassword][yourpassword]&lt;/config&gt;<br>
<br>
This works for me with UEFI bootloader. I don't know how to make this work with MBR.</div>
