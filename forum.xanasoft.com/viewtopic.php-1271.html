				<h3>Update Problem with SB+</h3>

				<div class="content">This problem started some months back.<br>
I'm using Windows 11 Pro.<br>
When updating SB+ from within the program the update stops with certain .dll files that it cannot replace.<br>
<br>
The files are:<br>
SbieShellExt.dll<br>
vcruntime140_1.dll<br>
vcruntime140.dll<br>
msvcp140.dll<br>
<br>
I have gotten around this by going into the Sandboxie folder in Program Files and renaming the these files. The system won't let me delete them.<br>
In the past I have also downloaded the new EXE and ran it in Window's Safe Mode. Wouldn't work if I tried running it within Windows 11, even via Run as Administrator.<br>
<br>
Seeing as nobody else is complaining about this I am assuming that it's peculiar to my system.<br>
<br>
Does anybody know if there is a setting in Windows 11 that needs to be changed.</div>

				<div class="content">Did that happen across multiple versions? I imagine there being an issue with the installer in some cases, but it shouldn't be reoccurring, unless there is a flaw in the updater's logic, in which case I'd expect it to be triggered for multiple people.<br>
<br>
You might want to back up your sandboxie.ini (usually located in C:\Windows; holding the configuration of Sandboxie and the sandboxes) the sandboxes themselves (if any, usually at C:\Sandbox\), maybe the sandboxie-plus.ini (containing UI settings, usually located at %AppData%\Local\Sandboxie-Plus\), your certificate.dat (if any) located in the installation folder of Sandboxie-Plus, then uninstall Sandboxie-Plus, just to do a clean installation.<br>
<br>
Please note that David changed the update procedure from within the user-interface for non-active, non-valid, certificates, so that the update from stable release to stable release is no longer automated. It requires a certificate to do an automated installation. Without a valid and active certificate, users are guided to the download page. Pre-releases are not covered. This change got made with Sandboxie-Plus 1.12.4.</div>

 <br>
It started at about 3 versions ago.<br>
As a Plus member I also had been installing the early release versions made available to us. Maybe I accidentally installed a Beta version.<br>
<br>
I was paying the lowest subscription that was available but then the rules changed and from what I remember my subscription no longer qualified me. The minimum subscription was increased (or introduced).<br>
Having said that my licence kept me going to the end of November when I had to renew the subscription.<br>
So it sounds to me that you may have hit the nail on the head about the changed update procedure being the cause, though there's always the chance that I did something silly<br>

				<div class="content">This should not be caused by you tempering with any setting. Just something that might went wrong.</div>
