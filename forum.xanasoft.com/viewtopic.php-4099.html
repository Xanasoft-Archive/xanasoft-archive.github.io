Sandboxie-plus 0.8.2 <br>
In a corporate Windows domain environment. <br>
Install was done as user with local admin rights, being run as standard user<br>
<br>
Launching iexplore.exe, it shows my web proxy settings and I can change them<br>
<br>
If I force iexplore.exe to run in my DefaultBox, it does not carry over my proxy settings and I am unable to re-enter them, clicking ok after doing so does nothing and does close the internet options window even. This is the case when iexplore.exe is ran as administrator as well<br>
<br>
Also, unable to uninstall from add/remove. After entering in user credentials with local admin rights, the uninstaller ask if I am sure -- i click yes and the uninstaller flashes and goes away.<br>
<br>
Any thoughts, suggestions etc would be greatly appreciated</div>

				<div class="content">I have reset the default box, and think this perhaps might be due to the proxy settings being applied via a GPO. Perhaps sandboxie doesnt like those reg keys because of this. It seems only iexplore has the issue strangley. Chrome.exe &amp; msedge.exe work ok<br>
<br>
The uninstall issue of sandboxie was related to Antivirus software preventing it and has been addressed<br>
<br>
Deployed on 50 workstations, just learning/working on tweaking this amazing application.</div>

				<div class="content">I had been using VPN services for 2 years before I discovered proxies. They turned out to be more reliable, safe, and up-to-date; that's why you don't even notice when you're connecting to proxy services, as the internet bandwidth remains the same, especially if you're using private proxies. I've discovered a source with a <a href="https://soax.com/residential-proxies" class="postlink">static residential proxy,</a> which is worth sharing. They offer reliable and affordable proxies. For instance, just for 20 proxies per month, you pay $26, which is nice because your internet speed is 10Gbps.</div>
