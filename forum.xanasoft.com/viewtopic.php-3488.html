				<div class="content">As the title says I can no longer start SandMan.exe because every time that I start it, it crashes. I have renamed the Sandboxie-Plus.ini file to *.bak so that it re-creates it but with no improvement.<br>
<br>
Things are now back to how they were with the very first versions of plus (+) which I found to be totally unstable and unusable. I then went back to the classic version for sometime until the plus version became more stable. Plus was fairly stable until before 1.0.8, it at least would run without crashing. 1.0.8 would run without crashing but stopped working and I updated to 1.0.9 hoping for some improvement but not so.<br>
<br>
BTW I do not want update checks and I wanted to disable that but cannot due to it crashing. Update checks never worked when it did run even when updates were available on github.<br>
<br>
Windows 7 x64 SP1<br>
Sandboxie Plus v1.0.9</div>

				<div class="content">Where can I find the crash dumps? I cannot access the Sandboxie interface because it crashes when I open it. I have tried searching but cannot find anything that looks like a log file therefore presumably logs need to be activated.<br>
<br>
The tray icon does show so it is loading but when I attempt to open the main window it always crashes. The Sandboxie window does briefly show on my desktop after opening from the tray with Show/Hide and then closes before I am unable to do anything.</div>

				<div class="content">I have downgraded to v1.0.3 and it runs as it should and the SB window can also be opened and everything works correctly. Then upgraded to 1.0.6 and it goes back to crashing when the main SB window opens. I have managed to find 1.0.4 and 1.0.5 in order to work out where the problems began.<br>
<br>
1.0.4 works but 1.0.5 does not.<br>
<br>
What changes were made between 1.0.4 and 1.0.5 that might cause the crashing?</div>

Thanks for the follow up on this matter. I have done as you have suggested and installed 1.0.11 and it crashed as soon as it ran after install. Following that I used Nirsoft DriverView to check that the driver was loaded which it was. The Service is also running. The Sandman window does open for a few seconds before closing even though I just leave it and do not interact with the window.<br>
<br>
I have added the debug info that I have and if there is anything else that would be helpful then please let me know.<br>
