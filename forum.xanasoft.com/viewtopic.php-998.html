<br>
First of all, I want to express my gratitude for your incredible dedication to Sandboxie Plus. I've been a Sandboxie user for several years, and due to fluctuating exchange rates, I couldn't contribute financially before. Now that I have a steady income, I'm keen on purchasing a subscription to support the program you've diligently developed for us over the years. I do have a couple of questions I'd like to ask:<br>
<br>
1- It's my understanding that the SANDBOXIE-PLUS SUBSCRIPTION is valid for a single computer, which is perfectly fine with me. However, I tend to reinstall my Windows system regularly (about once a month). Since I don't make any changes to my computer's hardware, I don't think this would pose an issue. Could you please confirm whether this could become a problem?<br>
<br>
2- If I contribute to your project via Patreon, which type of license will I receive? I assume it's equivalent to the "premium" license mentioned on <a href="https://sandboxie-plus.com/feature-comparison/" class="postlink">https://sandboxie-plus.com/feature-comparison/</a>, but I'd appreciate your confirmation on this.<br>
<br>
Once again, thank you immensely for your dedication and for addressing my queries. If my circumstances were better, I'd opt for the highest-tier option and make a substantial donation. Nonetheless, I hope that even a modest contribution will help you continue developing this remarkable product.<br>
<br>
Best regards.</div>

<br>
1- NO actually it's valid for all personal devices you own if you have a PC a laptop, a windows tablet and another backup PC you can use one and the same personal certificate on all of them.<br>
<br>
2- On Patreon You need to opt for 3€ or above tier to receive a certificate, the certificate you receive will be equivalent to this one <a href="https://xanasoft.com/product/sandboxie-plus-subscription/" class="postlink">https://xanasoft.com/product/sandboxie- ... scription/</a> with the <a href="https://xanasoft.com/product/sandboxie-plus-advanced-upgrade/" class="postlink">https://xanasoft.com/product/sandboxie- ... d-upgrade/</a> applied<br>
