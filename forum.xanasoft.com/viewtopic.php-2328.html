				<div class="content">Hello,<br>
<br>
I have a question regarding this software, can other softwares or apps that are not-sandboxed access softwares/files that are sandbox?<br>
I have a privacy concern regarding my employer while accessing personal social media platform or personal email accounts.<br>
I have heard that my employer IT Team can have access to those and I was hoping your software can solve this privacy concern of mine.<br>
<br>
So for example, my employer has a software that monitors the PC, which email are being sent, sites I visited or softwares installed on this machine,<br>
Sadly the only way to gain access to our private internet is through their software and I would like if I can be rest assured that my personal data is not shared or logged by my company's IT Team.<br>
<br>
I used to when ever not connected to my company's Network and I'm using my personal internet use a VPN for that kind of protection, but I got an email regarding the VPN and I had to remove it. It seemed they knew exactly the path the exe file of the VPN was and instructed me to delete it to ensure access to company network. <br>
<br>
Cheers!<br>
Salam</div>

Yes<br>
<br>
Is this PC your's or does it belong to the company?<br>
<br>
If their software is so invasive and the PC is yours, just install it in a virtual machine for work only and that should solve the issue.</div>
