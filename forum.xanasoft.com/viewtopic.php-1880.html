				<div class="content">Hi. <br>
I am working with application virtualization and I need to have different instances regarding the internet. I would appreciate big help related to the internet configuration of the sandboxie instances (original software running in appdata roaming). <br>
I have a software to have multiple IP address cards and to assign them to .exe files only, and I have tried to create portable .exe files, but I have not big knowledge in Turbo Studio, so I am working on it. I am familiar with the Virtual Box Oracle and with the Vmware, but please read the whole stuff.<br>
What I am looking for would be the final result of sandboxie instances (let's say 3+) having all the different network configuration in terms that the original software is behaving through sandbox instancing as a separate software, so 3+ separate softwares that are not in (when it comes to the internet) mutual connection one with eachother?<br>
<br>
I ve tried to use the command blockport=*,(the port I am using to the internet IP specific - the function is as described in the documents - blocking all ports except the one I am allowing) ... however, without results. I've tried it in a sandboxie plus, too. <br>
It simply does not work. All I need is having an abbility to assign my IP specifically to a specific instance, so that instance behaves differently than the original program - related to the internet.<br>
<br>
Do you have any suggestions based on Sandboxie (plus) configuration editing to turn it somehow for my needs?<br>
Or do you have any suggestions based simply on what am I looking for? Maybe using simultaneously more user profiles in Windows 10 (I ll google somehow) would be the best choice for this type of application virtualization? Or any software alternatives?<br>
<br>
P.S. I am not using it for anything illegal. That is what that kind of person would say it firstly, well... <br>
Anyway, I would really appreciate the help regarding the Sandboxie and this issue I have for a very long time.<br>

P.S.2. Best health. <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" width="15" height="17" alt=":)" title="Smile"></div>
