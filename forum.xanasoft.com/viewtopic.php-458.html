I hope you are well this December. I was wondering if you would benefit from any beta testers for the upcoming MajorPrivacy? I'm rebuilding a system soon, and this would be a good opportunity to test any MajorPrivacy release candidates you might be working on. I'm guessing others would be willing to beta test as well. Thanks again on your work to corral the shenanigans of MS and others.</div>

<br>
There were some delays so I think a beta would be ready after the holidays the earliest.<br>
<br>
Cheers<br>

				<div class="content">As promised this year you get the successor to the dated PrivateWin10, with build v0.90.0 <a href="https://github.com/xanasoft/MajorPrivacy/releases/tag/v0.90.0" class="postlink">https://github.com/xanasoft/MajorPrivac ... ag/v0.90.0</a> the first public build of Major Privacy gets online. There were a few things delaying the progress this year, so the build did not advance as far as I would have hoped, especially the UI is in a very early state, however most core features of private win 10 have been successfully ported to the new project.<br>
<br>
Currently it includes full windows firewall support, DNS Inspector and the Tweak engine, DNS filtering is missing.<br>
<br>
The next features to be added in the the upcoming builds (already mostly completed in the driver, missing only some glue logic UI) will be the Process Protection and Restriction rules. After that I will focus on the File System and Registry Protection as well as on the less important features.<br>
<br>
One new feature found its way in the planning, since the public announcement, Secure Drives. These are basically encrypted file hosted volumes, like offered by VeraCrypt and others, but safe guarded against unauthorized access using the File System Isolation and allowing only access  to selected Protected Processes.</div>
