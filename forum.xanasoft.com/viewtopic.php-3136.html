				<div class="content">During fast file retrieval from a browser opened in the virtual area, if the file to be recovered has the same name as a file already present in the destination path, the file overwrite request window is not placed in front of the recovery window, which can hide it until it is blocked, if the window is too large, such as in the case of a high DPI. In the video the recovery window partially covers the confirm/reject window, but sometimes it happened to me that it completely covered it, requiring me to use the Alt+tab combination to be able to turn it off, and regain control.<br>

Sorry for my English, and if the translation of the windows is not correct, I still hope with the video that I have illustrated the problem well.</div>

				<div class="content">I could understand what your issue was, and the video is very helpful.<br>
<br>
I opened an <a href="https://github.com/sandboxie-plus/Sandboxie/issues/2885" class="postlink">issue at the GitHub bug tracker</a>, to make sure it will be tracked. Potentially more people will see the problem and either it will be resolved by the developer or someone else provides code changes to remedy this.</div>
