				<div class="content">Hi,<br>
 I would like to start by saying, David has done wonderful job with sandboxie plus, it has really evolved over the years with such a robust app that has made it quite seamless to use in my experience, while having flexibility and the high protection layer. <br>
<br>
I am looking to migrate to Sandboxie plus from sandboxie legacy, for some reason I didn't take the initiative to upgrade for such a long time. <br>
At this point, what's the best approach to carry out the migration configuration from 5.56, I did take a look at the documentation page.<br>
<br>
Before I proceed, I would like to get some suggestion</div>

<br>
Upon installing Sandboxie Plus, it will be detected that Sandboxie Classic is being installed and you are asked if you want to remove it. Maybe you would want to create a copy (aka backup) of your Sandboxie.ini, although it should still be present after you proceeded with the removal and installation process.<br>
<br>
When you start up the new interface, you will see the sandboxes you have created before, being listed there. There are some options to change how it is going to look like. One of them is a vintage view, that tries to make it look like the older interface.</div>
