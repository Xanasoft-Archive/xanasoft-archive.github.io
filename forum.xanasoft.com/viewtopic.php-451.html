				<div class="content">if there is a second encrypted disk and an encrypted system partition, the boot freezes immediately after entering the password(the passwords for both disks are the same). perhaps this only manifests itself if the second disk is larger than 2TB(i have 6TB), since "your" bootloader strongly resembles a stripped-down version of the veracrypt bootloader(there are even tails of it preserved), but very ancient version. it seems that i have tried all the boot options, but even if specifying the partition does not help(allah! how shabbily it is done! and we blame veracrypt, but compared to your creation, veracrypt is the peak of engineering), then clearly that's not the problem.<br>
i didn't have any free disks left(i had to distribute 6tb across all the disks that i had) to check the assumption of 2tb, but i'm pretty sure that's the case, since i read the thread that the current bootloader is some kind of ugly crutch for gpt.<br>
<br>
ps: if the large disk is physically disconneted, then the booting is without problems. if remove the encryption from it, then there are no problems either. there are no problems with veracrypt, except that veracrypt itself has been the problem for about four years lol</div>
