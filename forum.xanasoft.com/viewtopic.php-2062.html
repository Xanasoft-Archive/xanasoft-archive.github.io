				<div class="content">Hello , <br>
<br>
I just downloaded what i though as a "small" video file which turned to be a very large one ( 3.5GB) .<br>
<br>
Sandboxie migration restriction was set to 500MB . It didnt prevent the migration and the file passed . <br>
<br>
I am guessing that the download was done by auto splitting the file into small parts ( without me knowing ) and joining it afterwords . <br>
<br>
Is there any way to stop such a migration of a large file if it splits and joins afterwords .  <br>
<br>
I am using sandboxie 5.33 .</div>

				<div class="content">It is unclear to me, how it could be prevented.<br>
<br>
What is also unclear is how this worked out, since when you download something with a sandboxed tool, the download will end up inside the sandbox, unless some path has been opened. Maybe the logic inside Sandboxie can be improved.</div>
