				<div class="content">Hello,<br>
<br>
Instead of asking the question one time, Sandboxie spams it very fast endlessly which causes problems.<br>
<br>
See attached photo and description.<br>
I lowered quality on the attachment so size would be accepted.<br>
<br>
Also, this error is not at <a href="https://sandboxie-plus.com/sandboxie/sbiemessages/" class="postlink">https://sandboxie-plus.com/sandboxie/sbiemessages/</a></div>

				<div class="content">It is awful and does it still as of today with latest version, never stopped.  <br>
<br>
I had also emailed support more about it long ago and got no reply.<br>
<br>
I have also tried to use the sandboxie plus self reporting thing to have it catch it and submit it, and nothing is ever done to fix this problem!  but doing that self report is difficult because piles and piles of that will stack themselves on the screen also because they are triggered by the pile of repeat errors!<br>
<br>
family hates sandboxie because of this. it is difficult for elderly to print anything with this awful error machine gunning itself and having to try to get the yes to take effect.  i dont know why it doesnt get fixed after years of this error!</div>

<br>
BTW, just as a workaround, you could disable printer isolation for certain boxes.<br>
<br>
Right-click on a sandbox in the user interface &gt; General Options &gt; [Restrictions] &gt; "Printing restrictions"</div>
