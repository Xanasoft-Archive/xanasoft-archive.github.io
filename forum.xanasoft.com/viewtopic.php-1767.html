				<div class="content">Wondering if DiskCryptor is still being developed?<br>
Will it survive big updates that change the OS and/or bootloader? (Can't be too specific as my previous post was rejected for unknown reasons.)</div>

				<div class="content">Sorry for that the phpBB UI is not very user friendly and has no undo button,<br>
please be as specific as you want.<br>
<br>
I'm using DC on all my machines so if there will be a breaking change I'll fox it as i need it for myself as well.<br>
<br>
So in that selse its still being developed.<br>
But I'm not actively working on new features right now.</div>

				<div class="content">Being more detailed now...<br>
<br>
So DiskCryptor is still being developed?<br>
<br>
Has it been tested on Windows 10 21H1?<br>
<br>
Will it support Windows 11?<br>
<br>
If Windows 10 (11?) makes major changes to the OS and/or the bootlaoder with the full disk encryption, will Windows still be bootable?</div>

				<div class="content">Why can't you answer a very simple question?   Not that you talk so badly about windows bitlocker.<br>
<br>
Is Diskcryptop being developed anymore or not?   It's been 18 MONTHS since the last update, and it's still BETA??<br>
How do convince people that beta diskcryptor is safer/better than bitlocker?</div>

				<div class="content">I answered the question already in the second post, I'm using it every day and if an issue comes up I'll fix it and release a new version.<br>
Until then whats the point in fiddling with the code and potentially breaking something?<br>
<br>
My last public build of DiskCryptor still works perfectly fine, with any windows 10 build as well as windows 11.<br>
Have my laptop on win 11 with DC already and everything works fine.<br>
<br>
imho it will be always BETA in order to ensure anyone uses it on their very own risk. <br>
<br>
why DC is better then bitlocker: <a href="https://diskcryptor.org/why-not-bitlocker/" class="postlink">https://diskcryptor.org/why-not-bitlocker/</a> its still as valid as the day i wrote it, and until MSFT does not change a lot it will remain so.</div>
