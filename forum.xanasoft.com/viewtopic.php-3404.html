				<div class="content">Hi.<br>
<br>
I tried to tinker with some sandbox settings and found out that the 'Hide processes' feature may not work as expected.<br>
Here is a screenshot of what I found:<br>

<br>
Do you think this is a bug? Or expected behavior?<br>
<br>
Thank you!</div>

<br>
There is indeed an <a href="https://github.com/sandboxie-plus/Sandboxie/issues/828" class="postlink">open issue</a>, at the time of writing.<br>
<br>
However, from the screenshot, I can tell that one of the processes being listed under "hide processes" is SandboxieRpcSs.exe and that this process is highlighted in the tool, which is to be expected, since that process runs in the sandbox the tool runs in. The processes that run in a box can be found by other processes run in the same box, so the same is true for the domlauncher.<br>
<br>
Also note, that sandman.exe is hidden. It is running, but the tool does not list it.</div>
