				<div class="content">Hello guys,<br>
<br>
I am an music producer and I searched for a way to make my DAW (music programm) portable/easy to take/transfer it to a new Windows installation. The problem is, that it's extremely time consuming and annoying to set up a DAW with all of the plug-ins and settings.<br>
So I had the idea to install my DAW and all of my plug-ins to Sandboxie. And so far it works pretty well: I was able to copy the sandbox (just for testing reasons) to my laptop and it instatly worked.<br>
<br>
How I did it:<br>
I copied the sandbox, created a new empty sandbox (with the same name) on my laptop and placed it in the right folder. Done.<br>
<br>
So my plan is it to use my sandboxed DAW and make backups of the sandbox folder. So when I have to reinstall windows or get a new pc, I don't have to install the whole DAW again.<br>
<br>
So thats why we need exporting/importing of sandboxes.<br>
I think it's not just a useful feature, it can be a new way of how to use Sandboxie. It turns Sandboxie from a sandbox programm into a sandboxing backup/software keeping programm! (If you guys don't already use Sandboxie like that and I am just a fool who thought he discovered something.  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" width="15" height="17" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing"> )</div>

				<div class="content">Well I'm using it this way, as you only need to copy the sandbox folder.<br>
An export / import feature would do the same, just more automatized, but yea I can add that, combined with 7z to pack and unpack from/to an archive</div>
