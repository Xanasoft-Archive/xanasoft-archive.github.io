				<h3>Sandboxie-Plus 1.10.5 Released</h3>
				<div class="date">Posted: <strong>Fri Aug 11, 2023 9:03 am</strong></div>
				<div class="author">by <strong>DavidXanatos</strong></div>
				<div class="content">This build adds a new scriptable troubleshooting wizard to help resolve sandboxing and UI issues, the wizard can be directly invoked from the SBIEMSG pop-up dialog. The settings dialog has been slightly restructured to add more space to update options, a bug was fixed causing the updater to run every day and not once per week, and a setting was added allowing to pick the update interval.<br>
We have also added an addon manager which allows installing additional components, like a script debugger for the troubleshooting wizard, a file checker, the logapi dll, and a few other useful addons.<br>
This build has also significantly reworked the low level injection mechanism, it should now work better and is much more flexible, although this being a large change requires some testing to ensure it works great on all scenarios.<br>

				<div class="content">Version 1.10.4 got reclassified from a release to a pre-release, since there has been an issue with business certificate validation. It still works, like it should, for non-commercial settings, so you can keep using it.</div>
