				<div class="content">Hi, <br>
<br>
Is there any limit to how many instances/boxes of the same program that you can run? <br>
<br>
When i start my 9th instance of the same program, it's constantly running/terminating the program back and forth in the sandbox application, therefore the program never starts. The other 8 programs which i launched first runs as intended. When i have the 8 programs running, the resoruce monitors show 1% of CPU, and 14% of physical memory used.</div>

				<div class="content">There should be no technical limitation within Sandboxie. There is a <a href="viewtopic.php-1169.html?f=14&amp;t=608" class="postlink">similar report</a>, which might be the same issue.<br>
<br>
I have no idea what kind of resources, other than RAM and CPU, which don't appear to be an issue in your case, could be responsible for it to be failing to launch more than X instances.<br>
<br>
You may consider opening a bug report in the <a href="https://github.com/sandboxie-plus/Sandboxie/issues" class="postlink">Github issue tracker</a>, where you can fill out the required details and have some people being able to look into it. Maybe there is a workaround. Maybe it is indeed a bug within Sandboxie, that applies to a wider range of programs, so it should be fixed.</div>
