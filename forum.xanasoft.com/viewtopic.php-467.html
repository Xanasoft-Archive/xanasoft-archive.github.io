				<h3>Question to Developer</h3>

				<div class="content">Hi,<br>
<br>
I use a laptop and started to encrypt an external SSD (harddrive) of 1 TB size. That SSD was almost empty, had only 3 empry folders on its main root.<br>
<br>
I started to encrypt, also using the Wipe feature. Encryption took already more than a day, when a power outage ended that attempt prematurely.<br>
<br>
When power was back, I was (happily) able to access the SSD through the password in DiskCryptor, and saw those 3 empty folders. but the encryption was never completed, only 21% were done. <br>
<br>
My question is now, what is the status of encryption, since the SSD was almost empty but encryption progress was only 21% ? There is no feature to cotinue an interrupted encryption. Do I need to restart encryption, or can the SSD be cinsidered as encrypted? Thanks.</div>
