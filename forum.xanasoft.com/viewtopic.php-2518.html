<br>
Wow. Yes, I know that &gt;.&lt;<br>
<br>
RED BOX = Firefox is Sandboxed = Because <span style="text-decoration:underline">Sandboxie is running</span><br>
NO RED BOX = Firefox is <span style="text-decoration:underline">NOT</span> Sandboxed = Because <span style="text-decoration:underline">Sandboxie is NOT running</span><br>
<br>
“In any case firefox is started in a sandbox, just that without sandman running you don't get the border. “<br>
<br>
Yes. Awesome, you can understand <span style="text-decoration:underline">one thing</span> that I’ve been trying to explain for weeks on this post. <br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong class="text-strong">Sandboxie needs to be started for the shortcut to work…</strong></span><br>
<br>
Now – here’s what you still can't seem to understand:<br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong class="text-strong">This is not how the old Sandboxie worked….</strong><br>
</span><br>
<span style="text-decoration:underline">Old Sandboxie</span>:<br>
1) Exit out of Sandboxie - (<span style="text-decoration:underline">Sandboxie is not running...</span>)<br>
2) Click on Firefox Shortcut<br>
3) <span style="text-decoration:underline">Sandboxie Automatically Starts</span><br>
4) Firefox Opens <span style="text-decoration:underline">Sandboxed</span> <br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration:underline">New Sandboxie</span>:<br>
1) Exit out of Sandboxie - (<span style="text-decoration:underline">Sandboxie is not running...</span>)<br>
2) Click on Firefox Shortcut<br>
3) Sandboxie <span style="text-decoration:underline">DOES NOT</span> Automatically Start<br>
3) Firefox Opens <span style="text-decoration:underline">UN-Sandboxed</span><br>
<br>
This is not that complicated...</div>

<br>
On what are you basing this assessment?<br>
<br>
In my tests it was never relevant if the UI is running or not, a process started using a sandboxie link always started sand boxed.<br>
like: C:\Program Files\Sandboxie-Plus\Start.exe /box:DefaultBox "C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\firefox.exe"<br>
<br>
The UI does not take part in this.<br>
<br>
From your video the only thing you show is that the red border is missing.<br>
Which is normal when the UI component is not active.<br>
<br>
If you claim that your link does not work and fail to start Firefox sand boxed when the UI is off, then <br>
1. post the details of your link how did you set it up, target etc...<br>
2. after you started Firefox and think it is not sand boxed, start the UI manually to verify that it is not sand boxed.<br>
<br>
Simply put demonstrate the suspected bug in a way that proves it, instead of making people thing you don't know how to operate the software.</div>

				<div class="content">OK,<br>
Finally we're getting somewhere. I can see now that it does run.<br>
<br>
I assumed that it was not running based on the fact there was no red border. Which is not an unreasonable assumption.<br>
<br>
This is still not how the old Sandboxie worked.<br>
<br>
With the old Sandboxie it would give the red border even if clicking on the shortcut without Sandboxie already being started. <br>
<br>
It's not very helpful having a sandboxed Firefox without the red border...<br>
<br>
I just checked to "Start UI when a sandboxed process is started."<br>
<br>
And that works. Even if Sandboxie is not already running it will bring up the red border. <br>
<br>
BUT it brings up the UI window too which I don't want. (This did not happen with the old Sandboxie. That version would evidently start the UI without opening the UI window.)<br>
<br>
Is there a way to get it to start the UI without bringing up the window?... <br>
<br>
(I can see now that the Old Sandboxie must have had this option checked; and it's what I've been trying to achieve. But because the UI window is popping up with the new version, it made me think it was all working differently - when that is the only real difference.)<br>
<br>
"Simply put demonstrate the suspected bug in a way that proves it, instead of making people thing you don't know how to operate the software."<br>
<br>
Maybe I would have learnt how to do this weeks ago if someone had bothered to explain. <br>
I assumed it was possible, and asked a few times if it is was, but no one would answer.</div>

Sorry for getting annoyed; it's frustrating when you think your being very clear and people still don't understand what your talking about.</div>
