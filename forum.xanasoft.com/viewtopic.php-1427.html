				<h3>Sandboxie &amp; the modern 'Adguard Browser Assistant' compatibility issue</h3>
				<div class="date">Posted: <strong>Wed Jul 06, 2022 10:28 pm</strong></div>
				<div class="author">by <strong>Bros</strong></div>
				<div class="content"><strong class="text-strong">Adguard for Windows</strong> software release somewhere at August 2020, a brand new modern <strong class="text-strong">Adguard Browser Assistant</strong>.<br>
From then it is available for download and installation as extension for mainstream Web browsers, such as for Mozilla Firefox:<br>
<br>
<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/adguard-browser-assistant/" class="postlink">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefo ... ssistant/ </a><br>
<br>
On the other word, you can just open your installed <strong class="text-strong">Adguard for Windows</strong> software on your computer -&gt; <strong class="text-strong">Settings</strong> -&gt; <strong class="text-strong">Browser Assistant</strong>: and press "<strong class="text-strong">Get the extension</strong>" green color online button here, and you will instantly have an option to install a modern <strong class="text-strong">Adguard Browser Assistant</strong> for your appropriate (default) Web browser...<br>
<br>
Adguard corp. create that modern <strong class="text-strong">Adguard Browser Assistant</strong>, because it is a more stable and have more options than the old <strong class="text-strong">Adguard Legacy (non-browser extension version) Assistant</strong>, which you can also find in that same <strong class="text-strong">Adguard for Windows</strong> software -&gt; <strong class="text-strong">Settings</strong> -&gt; <strong class="text-strong">Browser Assistant</strong> page...<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Somewhere at that same time 2020, <strong class="text-strong">Sandboxie</strong> software was in the middle of the crossover process from Sophos corp., also the previous Sandboxie forum run by Sophos was just in shut down process..., so asking about the new Sandboxie Feature (or a bug fix) request in that crowdy situation, was not so much of a priority.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Now I am asking for help on <strong class="text-strong">Sandboxie</strong> new Feature request, that it can finally support a modern <strong class="text-strong">Adguard Browser Assistant</strong>, if it is in any way possible technically to do it, maybe also with parallel support with the official Adguard team, I do not know...<br>
<br>
In the meantime, for last two years, <strong class="text-strong">Sandboxie</strong> software still works with the old <strong class="text-strong">Adguard Legacy (non-browser extension version) Assistant</strong>, but the future of it is blurry, especially in a light that it already passes two years, and Adguard corp. can redraw and simply shut down the old <strong class="text-strong">Adguard Legacy (non-browser extension version) Assistant</strong> at any moment.<br>
After all, the modern <strong class="text-strong">Adguard Browser Assistant</strong> is on the market for 2 years already, totally enough time for various compatibility issues settlement with other software on the market and with the modern <strong class="text-strong">Adguard Browser Assistant</strong> here...<br>
Besides that, the modern <strong class="text-strong">Adguard Browser Assistant</strong> is a more stable and have more options than the old <strong class="text-strong">Adguard Legacy (non-browser extension version) Assistant</strong>, and in the future, this will bring just even more and more of the gaps here...<br>
<br>
<br>
All in all, I also believe that <strong class="text-strong">IT Security</strong> and <strong class="text-strong">Privacy</strong> need to always join forces together. <br>
Some really good <strong class="text-strong">VPN</strong> service and the <strong class="text-strong">Adguard</strong> software, are so precious today considering the Privacy..., same as <strong class="text-strong">Sandboxie</strong> software and our <strong class="text-strong">AV</strong> software, are so precious in the IT Security manner... We simply need all 4 of them, as a basic protection today...<br>
<br>
So, if you can, please make <strong class="text-strong">Sandboxie</strong> software and the <strong class="text-strong">Adguard</strong> software more compatible again, and that they better and up-to-date back coexist together.<br>
<br>
<br>
Thank you in advance and best regards!</div>

				<div class="content">The issue is, that the new modern <strong class="text-strong">Adguard Browser Assistant</strong> extension in <span style="text-decoration:underline">sandboxed</span> <strong class="text-strong">Mozilla Firefox</strong> Web browser for e.g., cannot even see for last 2 years, the connection with its own <strong class="text-strong">AdGuard for Windows</strong> installed application on the PC which sitting in the Tray, and they need to be both connected under the hood (the AdGuard for Windows software + AdGuard Browser Assistant extension), to function properly! <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_e_sad.gif" width="15" height="17" alt=":(" title="Sad"><br>
<br>
So, I was thinking here that Sandboxie need to "un-sandbox" somehow this AdGuard Browser Assistant extension totally, as an "exclusion rule" all here (and set this exclusion as a new optional Sandboxie setting that we can apply, if someone has also an AdGuard for Windows application on their PC...)<br>
<br>
... Or to do all this, by joint Sandboxie operation with official AdGuard software team, because fixing this is on mutual interest of both, including the users like me, that use this both great pieces of the software in the first place..., and perhaps it is impossible to fix this serious problem, if not in join forces all here, I do not know.<br>
<br>
I only know that one day AdGuard for Windows application will completely shut down their old <strong class="text-strong">AdGuard legacy assistant</strong> that still bearably and somehow function even last two years and even now..., and from that moment, all the AdGuard for Windows application users will be in so serious problem - to use the AdGuard for Windows application only on their PC, or to use the Sandboxie application on their PC only, because you cannot use them together on the same PC. <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_e_sad.gif" width="15" height="17" alt=":(" title="Sad"></div>

				<div class="content">I do not want to sound ungrateful or inpatient in any way here, of course...<br>
<br>
But, since it already pass a one whole year from my initial reporting of this problem here,<br>
I am just asking now, is there perhaps any more advances on this above mentioned problem to be fix?<br>
<br>
Or, is there any way that I can even additionally and technically help that this problem will be again successfully fix?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Once more thank you in advance for all the help and best regards!</div>

<br>
Well, I can confirm that after I copy and paste your text code at the end of <strong class="text-strong">Sandboxie</strong> -&gt; <strong class="text-strong">Configure</strong> -&gt; <strong class="text-strong">Edit Configuration</strong> file, the modern <strong class="text-strong">AdGuard Browser Assistant </strong>start to miraculously works in my sandboxed <strong class="text-strong">Mozilla Firefox</strong> web browser, very great thanks for helping me out!  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="17" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"> <br>
<br>
And not only that, now the whole new <strong class="text-strong">AdGuard (Browser Assistant)</strong> entry is present even via <strong class="text-strong">Sandboxie</strong> -&gt; <strong class="text-strong">Configure</strong> -&gt;  <strong class="text-strong">Software Compatibility</strong> list!  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="17" alt=":D" title="Very Happy">  <br>

<br>
Once more thank you hugely for helping me out, and to the whole others, as my believe is that this will become more and more a widespread solution, since <strong class="text-strong">Sandboxie</strong> is a great for IT Security, same as <strong class="text-strong">AdGuard</strong> for protecting privacy and get rid of so many ads and similar in today's World!<br>
<br>
Cheers!  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="17" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"></div>
