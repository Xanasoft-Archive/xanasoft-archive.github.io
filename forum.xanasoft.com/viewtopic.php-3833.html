				<div class="content">Currently this is not supported, as its not really a usefull feature and more fake than secure.<br>
You see, the old sandboxie sure can delete the files left in the end in a sandbox,<br>
but it does not do anything of that sort with files created and deleted during the boxes operation.<br>
<br>
So for example chrome wants to save a bookmark file, it creates a new file saves the bookmarks to it, deletes the old bookmark file and than renames the temp file to be the new bookmark json file<br>
and it does that 10's of times basically each time something about the bookmarks changes.<br>
All these files are not erased securely at all.<br>
<br>
Also if you have a SSD you _CAN_NOT_ erase anything securely die to wear leveling, i.e. your SSD transparently reaping sectors and your overwriting hits other sectors than the original data was in.<br>
<br>
So if you need to securely get rid of you a sandbox, create a encrypted file based container using for example veracrypt, and point your sandbox to that location, once you are done using it, forget the password and create a new container.<br>
<br>
This described strategy is the only one that offers meaningful security on a SSD system</div>
