				<div class="content">I Just installed Diskcryptor and encrypted my Main hard Drive and now it wont Accept my Password on the Startup. I read that its because of UEFI and you shouldnt Install it ob Win10, but it's too late for that. Is there anything i can do to get access ? I have a bunch of stuff i can't lose in that Drive...</div>

Is it not asking for it<br>

<br>
in any case you can put the drive into an otehr PC or boot a windows live installation with DC and try accessing your files</div>

				<div class="content">Hi, if you do not have the password for the disk is there any way to decrypt the hard drives any other way? I know it is counter intuitive but unfortunately this is the situation i have found myself in.  Thanks in advance L</div>

				<div class="content">One evening I decided to move the excess free space from one drive to another, because I was running out of free space on the drive with the Windows. The second disk was encrypted and I wanted to decrypt it, but a glitch occurred, an error popped up and the computer rebooted. After that, the system would not accept my password at startup. I ended up having to reinstall windows and buy <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GetComputerHelp/comments/y17yo3/where_to_get_a_windows_10_key/" class="postlink"><span style="color:#000000">windows 10 key reddit</span></a> to get windows activated. I was able to solve the original memory problem, but I don't know how to decrypt my second drive and maybe someone on this forum can help me.</div>
