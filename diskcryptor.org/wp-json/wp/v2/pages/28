On execution of <code>dccon.exe<\/code> file without parameters, the program lists a brief description of the available commands.<\/p>\n<h3>Disk and partition naming conventions<\/h3>\n<p>Some of the commands require user to specify a disk or a partition, to which they are going to be applied. A disk partition can be specified either by a sequence number, or by a mounting point. There is a sequence number for any partition, even if it does not have a mounting point, and it looks like this, - <code>pt0, pt1... pt[n]<\/code>. The mounting point of a partition, is either the letter of the disk, or its full path (when mounting a partition to NTFS directory). To list the partitions, you can launch the program with the <code>-enum<\/code> switch.<\/p>\n<p>The commands for working with the bootloader, require specification of a physical disk instead of a partition. Disks are being named as <code>hd0, hd1... hd[n]<\/code>, and you can see their list by executing program with the <code>-boot enum<\/code> switch.<\/p>\n<h3>Program component installation\/removal switches<\/h3>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Command<\/th>\n<th>Action<\/th>\n<\/tr>\n<\/thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>-version<\/td>\n<td>Displays program version.<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>-install<\/td>\n<td>Installs DiskCryptor driver in the system.<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>-remove<\/td>\n<td>Removes DiskCryptor driver from the system.<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>-update<\/td>\n<td>Updates DiskCryptor driver to a newer version.<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><\/td>\n<td><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<h3>Commands for operations with disk partitions<\/h3>\n<p>In order to execute these commands, the DiskCryptor driver must be installed.

When encrypting the boot or system partitions, the program will offer to automatically install bootloader with a default configuration. By default, the bootloader is being installed on HDD, that has last been used to boot the system from. Please note, that a system is not necessarily located on a boot HDD, which can be the case with multi-boot configurations. It is possible to install bootloader on HDD, CD\/DVD and USB disks.
