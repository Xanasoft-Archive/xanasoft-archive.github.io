Otherwise, there will be attempt to boot the system without password, according to the <strong>Booting method<\/strong> options. The default actions is also used on authentication timeout.<\/p>\n<h3>Booting method<\/h3>\n<p>This option sets the OS booting method on successful authentication.<\/p>\n<p>Authentication is considered to be successful, when it were possible to mount at least one encrypted partition on any of the disks. The default value of this option is set to load saved copy of MBR, which is similar to the boot process from unencrypted disk. Changing of this option might be needed for the creation of a multi-boot configuration and when placing the bootloader on external media. The number of available booting methods is dependent on the bootloader placing method.<\/p>\n<p>The following is full list of all available booting methods:<\/p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>#<\/th>\n<th>Options<\/th>\n<th>Description<\/th>\n<\/tr>\n<\/thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1<\/td>\n<td>Set &quot;load boot disk MBR&quot;<\/td>\n<td>Load saved copy of MBR, of the HDD, on which the loader resides.<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2<\/td>\n<td>Set &quot;load first disk MBR&quot;<\/td>\n<td>Load MBR from the 1st HDD, that has active partition.<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3<\/td>\n<td>Set &quot;load OS from active partition&quot;<\/td>\n<td>Boot from the active partition, of the HDD, on which the loader resides.<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4<\/td>\n<td>Set &quot;boot from first partition with appropriate password&quot;<\/td>\n<td>Boot from the first partition, password to which was accepted.<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5<\/td>\n<td>Set &quot;boot from specified partition&quot;<\/td>\n<td>see below<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><\/td>\n<td><\/td>\n<td><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<p>The 5th option - <em>boot from specified partition<\/em> needs the additional explanation. On choosing this booting method, there will be a list presented with mounted encrypted partitions, and you will be able to choose a partition from which to boot. The search for this partition will be carried out using <code>disk_id<\/code> of the functionary header of volume. This is unique 32 bit partition descriptor. The descriptor is located in the encrypted part of the header, and is accessible only after inputting password, thus it is impossible to determine from which partition the booting will be done, without knowing password.<\/p>\n<h3>Bootauth keyboard layout<\/h3>\n<p>This option allows to choose keyboard layout for entering password in the bootloader. The following layouts are available: QWERTY, QWERTZ and AZERTY.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The QWERTY layout is fully in conformance with the standard English US layout.<\/li>\n<li>QWERTZ and AZERTY layouts are supported in limited capacity, and only the followings sets of symbols are available: [a-z][A-Z][0-9].<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>While encrypting system partition it is strongly recommended to: create a Windows 2 Go boot drive.
